Speaking to Cynthia Fuchs about her motivations for portraying tourism in the film, Black explained:

> The genesis of the film came in the 1990s, when I spent time in Jamaica. Every day in the *Jamaican Gleaner*, the national newspaper, there were front page stories about some payment that wasn't being released because Jamaica didn't devalue rapidly enough or privatize quickly enough, or do drug-trafficking to the satisfaction of the United States. And these stories were repeated again and again. I was in shock because I had thought the IMF was something like the Red Cross. I didn't think they were that controlling, that they would have that kind of impact on the day-to-day running of the country. So I wondered how much autonomy the country had, if the outside forces had such influence on the really important policy-making. As I began to speak to people, and as is articulated in the film, everyone knows what's going on, in all classes, and yet, I, as a decently educated American, had no idea that this was going on. And that's how the tourist came to be — I wanted to ask why I had no idea what was happening. The tourist is a metaphor for privilege and lack of understanding. Jamaica needs to reinvent itself to meet the needs of the visitors. Consider the case of dance lessons: it could be that once, you visited a country and would go to a little bar and see people dance, and try out the new moves yourself; now, it's all contained in a little area, and spoon-fed in a soulless way.

> But at the same time, \[the use of the tourists\] is not just a criticism; I'm not just making fun of the Americans. I identify with them. I felt that there's a certain victimization in lack of knowledge, that I myself am part of. So the tourists are a metaphor for the lack of understanding, of our own policies, imposed in our name. I spoke to Jamaicans who work in hotels about the most absurd questions they get. And there were people would come to the island and not even know they were in a foreign country. Very often, the first question they would get is, “Where's the McDonald's?” And along with that, there's the adaptation of the Jamaica Kincaid text (*A Small Place*,[@kincaidSmallPlace1988] written in 1987 about Kincaid's own home, Antigua), and she uses a very militant, passionate voice to describe a postcolonial consciousness. I was interested, now that we've all accepted that colonization is wrong, to apply her postcolonial text to a neocolonial situation, and see how accurate it remains.
