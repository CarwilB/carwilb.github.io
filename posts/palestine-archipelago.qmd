## The fragmentary reality of Palestinian territory

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the designation of Area C ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_C)), the 62% of the 
occupied West Bank that Israel kept exclusive control over under the Oslo Accords.
That thirty year span is longer than the 28 years of Israeli military occupation
of the West Bank that preceded it, longer than the 22 years of Jordanian rule 
before that, and longer than the 28 years of British Mandate administration 
before that. Promised as a transitional stage, in which the land would be
"gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction," Israeli rule over Area C
is as close to permanent as any form of rule in modern Palestine.

In 2009, French cartographer Julien Bousac created a striking visualization of 
the fragmentation imposed by Area C and the continuing occupation of Palestinian
territory. That map imagined Israeli controlled areas parts of a sea,
inaccessible to Palestinians and posing fundamental challenges both to movement
within their country and to any independent future. 

I share it here as a starting point for envisioning Palestinian reality before
the 2023 Gaza war.
