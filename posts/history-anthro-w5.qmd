The research monographs that this week's readings shadow are Lewis Henry Morgan's [*League of the Ho-d√©-no-sau-nee, or Iroquois*](https://archive.org/details/leagueofhodnos00inmorg/page/n11/mode/2up) and James Mooney's [*The ghost-dance religion and the Sioux outbreak of 1890*](https://archive.org/details/ghostdancesioux00moonrich/page/n7/mode/2up). For a recommended sample of Mooney's work, see Chapter 2: ["The Doctrine of the Ghost Dance"](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~rfrank/class_web/ES-110/ETHN110articles/Plains/mooney_ps.pdf).
