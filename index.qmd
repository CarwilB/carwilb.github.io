### Welcome

This research notes website is an experiment born of crisis and grief.
Expect it to change forms before it settles.

It's a space where I will witness planned cruelty and human tragedies with numbers and data.
Because my primary research project archives the death of nearly seven hundred Bolivians who
lost their lives in political struggle and I need somewhere to reflect on what that means.

Because weapons sent by my country's government are inflicting quantitatively far greater 
losses weekly and we need data to make sense of how. 

Because using numbers and maps and wrapping my head around the scale of things can dramatically
change how I view the world. And I can share those perspectives through data.

Because carefully presented evidence offers a path through the public denial that keeeps power intact.

And because these are the tools I've been training myself to use, and they won't fit on my other 
main spaces for public reflection, including my blog: [Carwil without Borders](https://woborders.blog/).

Lastly behind this data, there is a lot of death. I've chosen not to look away.

'â€¦ AND O MY PEOPLE, OUT YONDER,
HEAR ME, THEY DO NOT LOVE YOUR NECK UNNOOSED AND STRAIGHT.
SO LOVE YOUR NECK; PUT A HAND ON IT, GRACE IT, STROKE IT AND HOLD IT UP.
AND ALL YOUR INSIDE PART'S THAT THEY'D JUST AS SOON SLOP FOR HOGS YOU GOT TO LOVE THEM.
THE DARK, DARK LIVER - LOVE IT, LOVE IT, AND THE BEAT AND BEATING HEART, LOVE THAT TOO.
MORE THAN EYES OR FEET. MORE THAN LUNGS THAT HAVE YET TO DRAW FREE AIR.
MORE THAN YOUR LIFE-HOLDING WOMB AND YOUR LIFE-GIVING PRIVATE PARTS, HEAR ME NOW, LOVE YOUR HEART. FOR THIS IS THE PRIZE.'
- Toni Morrison"}
