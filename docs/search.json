    "text": "Carwil Bjork-James is a cultural anthropologist who conducts immersive and historical research on disruptive protest, environmental struggles, state violence, and indigenous collective rights. He is the principal investigator of Ultimate Consequences, a digital archive on death in Bolivian political conflict, and author of The Sovereign Street: Making Revolution in Urban Bolivia. He is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and of Law at Vanderbilt University.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, he conducted ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews on social movements, race and space, protest tactics, and political change in Cochabamba, Sucre, and La Paz, resulting in a monograph, The Sovereign Street, and articles including “Binding Leaders to the Community” (Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 2018), “Race and the Right to Speak for the City: Political Violence in Bolivia’s 2006–2009 Stalemate” (UAS, 2019), “Unarmed Militancy” (American Anthropologist, 2020). Using both anthropological and historical methods, The Sovereign Street explores how pivotal public events generate political legitimacy, contribute to major (sometimes revolutionary) transformations in the balance of power, and provide models for future political action. The ethnographic evidence collected about these events—of social life as experienced through the human body, the meanings attached to places, and social movement practices—explains how grassroots movements exert leverage upon the state through protest.\nUltimate Consequences is a quantitative and qualitative database, unique in its depth and completeness of coverage, of all conflict deaths in Bolivia since October 1982. It is supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and a Digital Humanities Incubation Grant from Vanderbilt University. Drawing on the database, Prof. Bjork-James wrote an expert witness report for the plaintiffs in Mamani et al. v. Sánchez de Lozada et al., the first US Federal case to hold a head of state liable for human rights violations, and the white paper “Mass Protest and State Repression in Bolivian Political Culture” (Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, 2020). His published scholarship has addressed the evolving international human rights regime, social movement interventions into global governance, anti-indigenous racism and state violence in eastern Colombia, and socio-environmental conflicts and state environmental policy in the Andes.",

    "text": "Spectral Traces: Unveiling Power through Engaged Research on Violence\nIn alignment with this year’s AAA theme of “Ghosts,” this panel explores how research on individual deaths and acts of violence intersects with exposing larger systems of power. By examining specific instances of state and political violence, we aim to illuminate the structural forces that perpetuate cycles of oppression, displacement, and human rights abuses across diverse contexts.\nOur panelists investigate how communities grapple with the aftermath of violence, from engagement with grassroots movements to state-sanctioned forensic investigations. We consider the ways in which death, loss, and sacrifice are imbued with social and political meaning, often becoming rallying points for resistance and transformation. The panel delves into the complex relationships between violence and care, exploring how sites of trauma can be reclaimed and repurposed by affected communities.\nCentral to our discussion is the role of memory and commemoration in confronting past atrocities. We examine how societies navigate the liminal spaces between remembering and forgetting, and how mapping and documenting violent events can serve as both a scientific endeavor and a form of social mobilization. The panel also addresses the challenges of seeking justice and remedy in the wake of displacement and state violence, considering both formal legal processes and grassroots initiatives.\nBy focusing on specific case studies from Latin America and the Caribbean, we aim to draw broader conclusions about the nature of political violence and its long-term impacts on individuals and communities. Our interdisciplinary approach combines anthropological, historical, and forensic methodologies to uncover the often invisible structures that underpin systems of oppression.\nKey themes include:\n\nThe mobilization of death and sacrifice in social movements\nTransformation of spaces associated with state violence\nThe intersection of science, law, and community action in human rights investigations\nMapping and memorialization as tools for confronting past atrocities\nThe social history and ongoing consequences of forced displacement\nGrassroots and state-led approaches to transitional justice\n\nThrough these diverse yet interconnected topics, we seek to contribute to ongoing debates about historical memory, accountability, and the enduring legacies of political violence. By examining the “ghostly” remnants of past conflicts and their contemporary manifestations, we hope to shed light on pathways toward healing, justice, and societal transformation.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The second week’s readings tries to capture the “dawn” of anthropology in the Western Hemisphere (or perhaps the world engaged by European colonialism). It works not so much by seeking out the first sources chronologically as by capturing the range of different possible voices describing human and cultural others.1\n1 Carwil Bjork-James, Indigenous March in Defense of Isiboro Sécure Arrives in La Paz, Challenges Evo Morales Government (Background Briefing), October 16, 2011.\n\n\n\nCover of Las Casas’ A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (Seville, 1552)\n\n\n2 Bartolomé de las Casas, Bartolomé de las Casas and the defense of Amerindian rights: a brief history with documents, Atlantic crossings (The University of Alabama Press, 2020).3 Holger Henke and Fred Reńo, Modern Political Culture in the Caribbean (University of the West Indies Press, 2003).\nChronologically, the readings begin with the 16th century Spanish friar and missionary Bartolomé de las Casas (1484-1566), who wrote about the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and Central America.2 Las Casas is often credited as one of the first advocates for indigenous rights in the Americas, and his writings provide a critical perspective on the brutal treatment of native populations by European colonizers. Lewis Hanke3 profiles Las Casas as an anthropologist, specifically focusing on “his approach to the study of cultures so alien to his own” who used “the vast amount of material he had patiently gathered on various aspects of Indian life” to “understand the importance of their customs and beliefs within the framework of their own culture.”\nChristian Feest profiles4 early European reactions to Aztec and Mesoamerican art brought to Europe in 1521, the moment when the Spanish invasion of the Aztec empire was still ongoing. Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) is one of the first Europeans to react to Mesoamerican art, and he did so highly positively noting, “And yet I have all days of my life seen nothing that has thus delighted my heart as these things. For I have seen among them wonderful artificial things and have wondered at the subtle ingenia of the people in foreign lands.”\n4 Christian F. Feest, A First European Assessment of Indigenous American Art, 1992.5 Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca, A Brief Description of All the Western Indies, ed. Kris Lane, Neil L. Whitehead, Jo Ellen Fair, and Leigh A. Payne (Duke University Press, 2008), 165–212, https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780822389064-010/html.Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca5 (1557-1622) took a different view, situating his descriptive work on “the Western Indies” (the Americas, but largely South America) alongside a manual of advice for Spanish soldiers and colonizers and a polemical defense of the conquest against critics like Las Casas.\nIn American Pentimiento,6 Patricia Seed reflects on Iberian and English descriptions of indigenous peoples in the Americas. She argues that these texts should be read not as straightforward ethnographic accounts but also texts shaped around the need to provide religious and moral justifications for the appropriation of indigenous lands and labor. The optional chapter, “Sustaining Political Identities” summarizes the overall argument of her book, while “Cannibals” details this storytelling in Spanish America.\n6 Patricia Seed, American Pentimento: The Invention of Indians and the Pursuit of Riches (University of Minnesota Press, 2001).7 Roger Williams, A key into the language of America (Bedford, MA : Applewood Books, 1997), http://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wOfpAPRxlVYC.8 Sarah Vowell, The Wordy Shipmates (Penguin, 2009).9 Ana González, Roger Williams and the Pequot War, n.d., https://explore.thepublicsradio.org/stories/roger-williams-and-the-pequot-war/.In the English colonization of North America (note that colonization precedes the 1706-07 union forming Great Britain), Roger Williams, the Puritan founder of Rhode Island, is among the first to publish an ethnographic text, A Key into the Language of America (1643).7 The excerpt from Sarah Vowell’s The Wordy Shipmates8 narrates this multivocal text as well as the Pequot War that preceded its publication. This podcast9 focuses on Roger Williams’ direct participation in the Pequot War.\n\n\n\nContemporary woodcut illustration of the Mystic massacre\n\n\nFinally, the first three chapters of Amitav Ghosh’s The Nutmeg’s Curse10 situate the contemporaneous events of the Pequot war and the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands in 1621-22. Ghosh’s up-close look at early colonial violence speaks to the decisions behind colonial violence as well as the interrelations among different colonial projects and the internal religious wars of Europe. The chapter that follows argues that the colonization of indigenous lands is also interrelated with the de-sacralization of nature in Europe through the scientific revolution.\n\n\n10 Amitav Ghosh, The nutmeg’s curse: Parables for a planet in crisis (University of Chicago Press, 2021).",

    "text": "On limitations of implementing AI in workplace settings\nUpwork research “surveying 2,500 global C-suite executives, full-time employees, and freelancers in the U.S., UK, Australia, and Canada”:\n\nThe majority of AI use appears to be emerging bottoms up, with workers leading the charge. Now, leaders are eager to channel this enthusiasm. Among the increased demands executives have placed on workers in the past year, requesting they use AI tools to increase their output tops the list (37%). Already 39% of companies require employees to use AI tools, with an additional 46% encouraging employees to use the tools without mandating that they do so.\n\n\nHowever, this new technology has not yet fully delivered on this productivity promise: Nearly half (47%) of employees using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect, and 77% say these tools have actually decreased their productivity and added to their workload.\n\n\nFor example, survey respondents reported that they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content (39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now being asked to do more work (21%).\n\nTechnology author Mayo Olshin: “If however, you simply”trust” the Al outputs due to lack of knowledge, skill, or willingness to review results, the long term damage will outweigh the initial productivity gains you got so “hyped” about.” A similar experience from David Chisnall on CoPilot: “It has cost me more time than it has saved.”",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Eleven people have died in social movement-related violence in Bolivia since the beginning of 2023, ten of them the victims of violence carried out by other social groups. These conflicts pitted rural community members against miners, as well as disputes within the same profession, be it mining cooperatives, urban transit drivers, or rival claimants to rural land. Only one death, in January 2023, was caused by security forces, who fired a projectile into the eye of a bystander during raucous protests over the arrest of right-wing governor Luis Fernando Camacho.\nIn addition, the government of Luis Arce attributed four deaths from medical causes to the side effects of pro-Evo Morales blockades in January 2024. (Per our codebook, we record such collateral consequences but exclude them from other analysis.)\n\nDeadly protest events, January 2023–August 2024\nThe recent events are as follows:\nCamacho arrest protests: The December 28 arrest of Santa Cruz’s governor (and ex-presidential candidate) Luis Fernando Camacho touched off immediate protests in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the regional capital. Following a one-day airport takeover, members of Camacho’s Civic Movement alternated between daytime blockades and nighttime property destruction. On New Year’s Day, police fired a projectile—likely a tear-gas canister—into the eye of Edwin Chávez Durán. The man enduring no fewer than seven surgeries over the next two weeks before succumbing to a heart attack on January 13.\nMapiri mining clash: Amid negotiations upon the filing of mining permits for a mine site located on the Merque river, confrontations began between prospective miners at the site and community members. The mining firm, Minera La Deseada, is described as Chilean, and the workers involed as arriving outsiders, some or all from Caranavi, according to the OTB of Mapiri, led by Ruddy Salcedo. Salcedo describes a Chilean business owner as present at the start of the confrontation, urging them to begin work by force. Community members occupied the disputed site, waiting for police to arrive. In the ensuing confrontation, stones, dynamite, and firearms were used, wounding ten people and killing Jhilmer Cuele Sompero. Community struggles challenging the La Deseada Mine have been ongoing for years; a 2020 mobilization shows leaders describing a five year struggle up to that point. In 2020, they were demanding the enforcement of a ruling by the national mining authority AJAM.\nLimoncito mining conflict: On March 1, police accompanied an inspection visit by AJAM to document the stone-mining operation of the Dracruz company, in Limoncito, El Torno municipality. The delegation was confronted by mine workers who launched rockets and otherwise attacked the inspectors and police. Amid a retreat, Sub-Lieutenant Ronald Choque Mamani suffered a cardio-pulmonary arrest and collapsed to the ground. (Initial reports of bullet wounds to the officer proved unfounded.) He could not be revived. Five men were taken into custody for investigation by the FELCC and prosecutors [@AutopsiaConfirmaQue2023]. Subsequent inspection on March 10 revealed an unpermitted mining operation extending over 16 hectares of municipal land. Police then took both heavy equipment and documentation from the company . Local residents had complained of the operation, and have an ongoing campaign against other illegal mining operations.\nSantagro rural land dispute: In El Puente municipality of Santa Cruz, conflict flared up between members of the Intercultural farmer federation, who established settlements there in December 2023, and the employees of the Santagro soy producing company, which works on the land. The armed confrontation on March 30 claimed the lives of two men, Francisco Morales and Jorge Pérez.\nCotoca land dispute: During a confrontation between established residents and squatters in Cotoca, Herland Salinas Añez was stabbed multiple times, first by a machete and then by a short blade knife (arma blanca) and killed. Several others suffered machete and bullet wounds during the confrontation. Witness reports describe the confrontation as continuing over several days. Police arrested 25 to 33 people, whom they investigated for the illegal land occupation. Per a more detailed report, the housing takeover was sudden and carried out by a group arriving in a van, making the squatters the attackers.\nLaji Lurizani mining conflict: Wilmer Chambi Salcedo, 25, was shot and died while in an ambulance transporting him from Apolo to La Paz. He was one of four wounded in a conflict in the Santa Rosa community in the Laja sector of Apolo on September 13, 2023. The violence resulted from a conflict between illegal miners and community members in the protected Parque Nacional y Área Natural de Manejo Integrado Madidi (PN-ANMI Madidi). On September 15, the Autoridad Jurisdiccional Administrativa Minera (AJAM) reaffirmed that no mining rights were granted anywhere in the protected area. The same day, police arrived in the conflict zone and took control of the Laji Lurizani community. Bitza Delgado, the wife of the deceased Wilmer Chambi Salcedo, demanded that the authorities move to find those responsible for his death.\nThe death marked a continued worsening of violence due to mining conflicts in the Apolo region of northern La Paz. Illegal and informal mining thrives in the region. On September 18, community members of Laji Lurizani arrived in La Paz’s Plaza Murilo to protest the activities of illegal miners and their backers, and the absence of the state. Residents testified and presented photographic evidence of how illegal miners force them under threat of violence to allow them to do what they want in the area.\nPailitas land dispute: A week of armed confrontation between interculturales and peasants disputing land rights in the Forest Reserve of the Ascensión de Guarayos province resulted in the death of the intercultural Félix Ribera Bellido (23) of San Julían and the injury of 14 others. The death occurred early on the morning of December 2, when a conflict erupted between the communities of Pailitas and Santa María (in the Los Londras area). On December 6, the leader of the interculturales of San Julían, Tito Rokas, threatened the death of landowners in the province, claiming they were responsible for the violence. President Luis Arce announced that the violence would not be tolerated and summoned an emergency meeting of ministers to analyze the land conflict and propose structural solutions. The director of the National institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA) emphasized however that the lands being fought over were in fact property of the state, as all of the properties lie withing the Gurayos Forest Reserve. The Bolivian Ombudsman’s Office condemned the violence and called upon all actors to lower the temperature and to find peaceful solutions to the conflict. On January 16, 2024, Heber Sixto Canaza Sacaca (47), one of the leaders of the San Julían syndicate, was charged with homicide, for his role in inciting the violence on December 2, and for land trafficking, due to his promise to deliver properties in the municipality to intercultural groups. He was apprehended and taken into custody on January 15 and transferred to Santa Cruz by the FELCC. Sixto Canza had also been previously involved in another armed conflict in the Las Londras area in 2021, during which a group of journalists, police, and businessmen were kidnapped and tortured.\nCochabamba transit clash: A taxi driver suffered blunt force trauma while being attacked by drivers of a rival union of drivers disputing their line. One report indicates he and his brother were dragged out of their vehicle and held in another, possibly suffering the wound when jumping out of the vehicle. A doctor described blunt trauma inflicted by a large stone.\nGuanay mining clash: Conflict among miners resulted in two injuries (both with metal shrapnel) and the trauma-induced heart attack of Mauricio Soliz Miranda.\nYani mining conflict: National Police intervened in the Yani community of Sorata municipality where two groups of cooperative miners were in open confrontation. This confrontation included injuries from firearms suffered inside the mine the night of July 25. Sent to accompany officials from AJAM and to de-escalate the conflict, the police were confronted by members of one side of the dispute. Reportedly, the miners threw rocks and dynamite at the arriving police, and set the hill on fire. Caught in the flames, two police officers suffered severe burns to 70% and 80% of their bodies respectively. One of those burned, Fabricio Reynoso Gutiérrez, succumbed to his injuries in a La Paz hospital. Altogether, four police were hospitalized. Two alleged perpetrators were arrested and held in preventative detention. One party to the dispute was the Cooperativa Minera “Señor de Mayo”, seemingly the side complaining of illegal occupation of their stake, while the other side (per a social media post circulated by Señor de Mayo) is known as Hijos de Ingenio. The latter allege further violence by Hijos de Ingenio, including a shooting on the following day.\n\n\nThe pattern of violence under President Luis Arce has shifted from past conflict\nAs we near the end of Luis Arce’s fourth year as president, it’s now clear that political violence in Bolivia has taken a new shape. The left–right conflict, which claimed 38 lives during the 2019 political crisis (most of them shot dead during grassroots protests against the newly installed Áñez government), has receded in violence. Five deaths occurred from this longstanding divide.\n\n\n\nDeaths by presidency since 2001. Click to view this chart since 1982\n\n\nPublic protest in Bolivia remains active as ever, but there has been little deadly violence between police and people protesting the government. Only two people have been killed in sociopolitical conflicts by security forces, a jailed official who died after mistreatment and a protester wounded by a less-lethal munition. Only one presidency saw less lethal violence by Bolivian security forces since 1982: Eduardo Rodríguez’s eight-month interim government. Comparable restraint was shown under the leadership of Hernán Siles Zuazo (1982–85) and Carlos Mesa (2003–05).\nInstead, it is local and inter-movement conflicts that are taking the deadliest toll: 32 deaths in four years. Additionally, all three of the deaths of state security forces came in instances where the Arce government intervened to stop violence between conflicting communities of its own supporters, in conflicts over coca union leadership in Apolo, over mining in Sorata and El Torno.\nWith the exception of two university student government-related tragedies, in Potosí and El Alto, these are competitions over land, employment, and environment. These conflicts are the dark side of a literal gold rush in northwest Bolivia and a fundamentally similar rush for rural land and space for housing on the urban periphery. Asserting collective claims to land or mining rights is not new in Bolivia, but disputes among competing groups have become increasingly violent in a handful of regions, with mining collectives, agribusiness companies, and intercultural settlers increasingly turning to firearms in clashes to defend their claims. These groups are part of large economic strata, notably cooperative miners and intercultural peasants, who participate in the grassroots coalition behind Bolivia’s governing party, complicating the government’s management of such conflicts. Meanwhile the administrative agencies, AJAM for mining and INRA for land frequently find themselves asserting that one even both sides of these conflicts have a legal right to disputed territory.\n\n\n\nDeadly events during the Arce administration by protest domain and locale\n\n\nRelative restraint by the Arce government in the use of deadly force has been a welcome change from the massacres of the interim government. The remaining question is whether the Movement Towards Socialism can adjudicate disputes over land and calm local tensions within its grassroots base.\nClick here for an interactive directory of directory of all deaths recorded in the dataset.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Violent death cast a shadow over multiple social movements in Bolivia during the third calendar year of President Luis Arce. Deliberate killings came in clashes over land, mining, and the planned census, claiming eight lives, while tear gas detonated in a student meeting led to a stampede in which five were killed. A government bureaucrat who exposed a major corruption scandal died of years of mistreatment in prison. A motorcyclist was killed by a wire strung as part of a road blockade. And a brutal stabbing killed another participant in road blockades. Altogether, fifteen Bolivians lost their lives in or around Bolivia’s often charged movement conflicts.\nThe deadly events were as follows:\n\nLa Estrella land clash, March 19: Intercultural farmers had moved on March 12 to occupy lands on the “La Estrella” ranch, owned by Jacob Ostreicher and subject to claims of money laundering in a 2011 case that attracted international attention. These land occupiers were attacked on March 19 by armed people, either farmworkers or hired attackers presumibly sponsored by in-country landowner Claudia Liliana Rodríguez. (Ostreicher remains in exile.) The attackers confronted the Intercultural squatters around 22:00, shooting rockets and firing firearms. Franklin Delgadillo, son of Intercultural leader Ricardo Delgadillo, was shot and killed. The Interculturales maintained a multiday blockade demanding justice afterwards. Police arrested at least nine people for the killing in March 2022.\nDeath of imprisoned Indigenous Fund official, April 19: Marco Antonio Aramayo, the former director of Bolivia’s Fondo Indígena, died in custody following seven years of detention under an abusive avalanche of investigations in a scandal he himself brought to light. The Fondo Indígena, which Aramayo headed from 2013 to 2015, was intended to provide independent funding to indigenous communities for development and self-representation. Aramayo denounced in 2016 that the Fund was instead used by Minister Nemesia Achacolla as a slush fund during an election year.\nWhile many have been accused of corrupt acts, Aramayo has borne the highest weight of prosecutions (over 250 investigations begun); he was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in 2017. ITEI, a Bolivian organization that supports victims of torture and state violence, issued a statement: Aramayo’s “death is the tragic conclusion of a series of violations of [his] fundamental rights,” “which affect [him] and also affect people deprived of liberty in general.” According to the ITEI, which has provided medical and psychological attention to him since 2017, police and penal authorities tortured Aramayo physically with beatings and stress positions; biologically by depriving him of food, water, or medicine; psychologically with threats, extortion, insults, and humiliation. Aramayo was repeatedly required to travel to attend new cases across the country, with the final one filed two weeks before his death. Exhausted from his ordeal, Aramayo died of multiple organ failure, aggravated by diabetes and hypertension. While police announced an investigation into his death, his legal representative denounced that no actions had been taken three weeks later.\nPotosí university stampede, May 9: A nightmarish stampede ensued at Potosí’s Tomás Frías University after a tear gas grenade was set off during an indoor meeting to convene university federation elections. Some five thousand students were reportedly in the coliseum. Many were injured in the rush to flee, including four who were killed that day and one more who died on June 15. Reportedly two of the dead were mothers who leave behind children. Six were sent to intensive care. Between 71 and 83 were wounded. The tragedy was apparently amplified by the locking of the main exit doors.\nBolivian student politics operates in close coordination with national political parities and is often highly contentious. The tragedy also put attention on student leaders who maintain student status over decades and accumulate patronage and power in on-campus political organization.Four students, at least two of them involved in student politics, have been arrested in connection with the gas release and its deadly consequences. The Minister of Justice names Manfred Flores Canaza as the “principal and material author” of the crime.\nTinguipaya clash, May 15: Two men died in fratricidal violence in the town of Tinguipaya, Potosí. The brawl between differently organized Indigenous people—ayllus vs. campesinos—followed a visit by Vice President Choquehuanca and involved stones, sticks, slingshots, and rockets. Ironically, Choquehuanca’s speech, marking the opening of a political training school, had called for cross-cultural unity and fearless speech. The cause of the conflict remains totally disputed: national MAS-IPSP official attributed it to a local land conflict, while some local figures and opposition politicians blamed internal partisan disputes within the MAS-IPSP linked to the local mayor. Police attempting to investigate the incident had difficulty entering the area in the following days.\nChiñijo land clash, June 23: On June 23 a confrontation over land ownership in the community of Tamiplaya Tolapampa in Chiñijo, Sorata resulted in the beating deaths of two local campesinos and injury to an additional five. A group of 60 land-grabbers, hired and led by Gabriel Callisaya Toledo, Mario Luque, and Genaro Quito attacked the community in attempt to take their land, intimidating them with dynamite, dogs, and firearms. The General Secretary of Chiñijo, Susana Silva, claimed that Sorata police refused to provide assistance or to remove the bodies of the victims and only arrived at the on the 26th. Communities members protested by taking the victims’ bodies to Sorata in a protest march in order to demand justice. The community members possessed a resolution from the National Institue of Agrarian Reform (INRA) that recognized their right to the property and instructed the police to forcefully evict unlawful occupants.\nMapiri mining cooperatives clash, June 24: A group of expelled members of the Hijos de Pueblo gold mining cooperative attacked the cooperative in the community of Charobamba, Mapiri, in an attempt to regain leadership. A local teacher, Faustino Nestor Maqui Chambi, was killed when he was hit in the head by a stone, causing him to fall from his boat and drown. Police arrested 7 or 8 of the agressors, but their convoy was attacked in Aguada while transporting the arrested persons to La Paz and one the arrestees escaped.\nSanta Cruz census strike, deaths on October 22, November 9 and 10: The Santa Cruz Civic Movement mounted a 36-day department-wide strike in protest of the delay of the Census to 2024, and demanding it be held in 2023. Clash between supporters of Santa Cruz general strike and those attempting to open blockades. During an October 22 clash on the Amistad bridge that connects Santa Cruz with Brazil, a municipal employee of Arroyo Concepción, Julio Pablo Taborga, suffered injuries from blows to his head. He was transported to a hospital in Puerto Quijarro where his death was recorded early the next morning. According to Taborga’s wife, he was demonstrating against the blockade when supporters of the strike arrived with dynamite and homemade bombs and began to beat him. Video of the confrontation appeared to show victim succumbing to tear gas rather than a beating. The Santa Cruz Civic Committee released a statement blaming the MAS for the conflict.\nEduardo Arancibia Barrancos was killed in the early morning of November 9 while driving a motorcycle to work. He attempted to drive through a blockade point in the Tres Lagunas neigborhood of Santa Cruz. He did not notice that a coaxial cable was stretched across the road between two poles. This cable cut through his upper neck as he drove, causing his death. Police arested five men who were maintaining the blockade point.\nOvernight on November 11, a group of four or five people attacked two men who were maintaining a blockade in the Barrio Latino of the Los Lotes zone of Santa Cruz. The attackers assaulted Jairo Montero, 21, and José Eduardo Sosa, 28, with knives, leaving Montero hospitalized with criticall injuries and Eduardo Sosa dead. The Sosa’s heart was reportedly cut out of his chest by the attackers. Two of the attackers were arrested on November 15.\n\n\n\n\nTable of deaths in 2023\n\n\n\nTrends in protest deaths\nThe death in custody of Marco Antonio Aramayo marks the first social-movement-related death at the hands of the state under the presidency of Luis Arce. Otherwise, responsibility for these deaths rests among civilians and generally within social movements themselves, though the motives of the assault on José Eduardo Sosa need to be clarified. While international attention tends to focus on left-right partisan conflict in Bolivia, local conflicts over rural land (three to five deaths), mining (one death in Mapiri), or political affiliation made up the bulk of deaths in 2022.\nDeadly state violence against protesters, the modal situation in four decades of recorded death in the database, remains at a standstill. No security forces have killed a Bolivian protester since the Senkata massacre on November 19, 2019, and MAS-IPSP governments last saw a state-perpetrated killing in August 2018. Over the last four decades, state-perpetrated violence occurred more than six times as often under right wing governments as under left-wing ones (13.0 vs 2.1 deaths per year). Conversely, violence among civilians is 38% more frequent during left governments (5.64 vs 4.08 deaths per year).\nAs can be seen in the list above, investigation of the prepetrators of political violence was uneven, with the Tinguipaya clashes and the Aramayo death in custody possibly becoming the latest examples of impunity for violence. The extraordinary systemic delays in the Bolivian justice system make it likely that accountability for political violence in 2022 could take years to come through the judicial system.",

    "text": "Carwil Bjork-James is the principal investigator of Ultimate Consequences, a digital archive on death in Bolivian political conflict and the author of The Sovereign Street: Making Revolution in Urban Bolivia.. He is a cultural anthropologist who conducts immersive and historical research on disruptive protest, environmental struggles, state violence, and indigenous collective rights. He is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and of Law at Vanderbilt University.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, Prof. Bjork-James conducted ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews on social movements, race and space, protest tactics, and political change in Cochabamba, Sucre, and La Paz, resulting in a monograph, The Sovereign Street, and articles including \"Binding Leaders to the Community\" (Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 2018), \"Race and the Right to Speak for the City: Political Violence in Bolivia's 2006–2009 Stalemate\" (UAS, 2019), \"Unarmed Militancy\" (American Anthropologist, 2020). Using both anthropological and historical methods, The Sovereign Street explores how pivotal public events generate political legitimacy, contribute to major (sometimes revolutionary) transformations in the balance of power, and provide models for future political action. The ethnographic evidence collected about these events—of social life as experienced through the human body, the meanings attached to places, and social movement practices—explains how grassroots movements exert leverage upon the state through protest.\nUltimate Consequences is supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and a Digital Humanities Incubation Grant from Vanderbilt University. Drawing on the database, Prof. Bjork-James wrote an expert witness report for the plaintiffs in Mamani et al. v. Sánchez de Lozada et al., the first US Federal case to hold a head of state liable for human rights violations, and the white paper \"Mass Protest and State Repression in Bolivian Political Culture\" (Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, 2020). His published scholarship has also addressed the evolving international human rights regime, social movement interventions into global governance, anti-indigenous racism and state violence in eastern Colombia, and socio-environmental conflicts and state environmental policy in the Andes."

    "text": "This week’s readings attempt to capture anthropological thinking at the moment when Enlightenment thought is seeding the formation of the modern research university. While it will take some further decades for “the science of man” to escape from Natural History and take its place alongside other social scientific disciplines in the Western Academy, essential foundation for all three of these elements in that story (anthropology, the research university, and the social sciences) were all being laid around 1800.\nThis larger story is the reason why we return to Eric Wolf’s “Introduction” to Europe and the People Without History1 this week. Wolf’s book attempts a six-century account of global processes in which both colonizing and colonized societies were radically transformed and his introduction make the theoretical case that the often-presumed object of anthropological study, distinct “traditional societies,” each with their own “culture,” is an illusion.\n1 Eric R. Wolf, Introduction (Univ. of California Press, 1982).\nBy turning names into things we create false models of reality. By endowing nations, societies, or cultures with the qualities of internally homogeneous and externally distinctive and bounded objects, we create a model of the world as a global pool hall in which the entities spin off each other like so many hard and round billiard balls. Thus it becomes easy to sort the world into differently colored balls… (6)\n\nRelevantly for this week, Wolf describes “The Rise of the Social Sciences” in an argument which is more of an intellectual lament than a chronological account. For Wolf, sociology, political science, and economics are incomplete disciplines, which artificially sever certain relationships from the broader whole, most crucially by failing to take an integrated look at political economy. He notes that sociology was initially a political project aimed at fostering social cohesion (on this point, see more directly Mostajir2), and that political science and economics have been oriented around formal models of their spheres of interest that leave out that which is crucial.\n2 Parysa Mostajir, Social Physics, Industrialization, and the French Revolution, n.d., https://voices.uchicago.edu/pmostajir/2020/10/19/history-of-social-science-lecture-4-social-science-industrialization-and-the-french-revolution/.3 Immanuel Kant, “Beantwortung Der Frage: Was Ist Aufklärung?” Berlinische Monatsschrift, December 1784.4 Immanuel Kant, Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, 1799.5 Michel Foucault, What Is Enlightenment?, n.d., https://foucault.info/documents/foucault.whatIsEnlightenment.en/.All of this separation and stratification has taken place in the context of the modern research university, that entity that emerged in the 19th century as states worked to formalize the space of intellectual inquiry demanded by Enlightenment thinkers. In the readings these are represented by Immanuel Kant’s essay, “What is Enlightenment?”34 and the commentary on it by Michel Foucault.5 Without denying that the state is due the obedience of the public, Kant urges the right to freedom of argument.\nThe devastating invasions by Republican and Napoleonic France taught a stinging lesson to the still-divided German-speaking realms, and “counter-Enlightenment” reforms of society included the creation of new academic, military, and state institutions. Germany’s Humboldtian universities set out the basic contours of modern academic life: tenure, freedom of thought for professors, unity of research and teaching, and isolation from non-scholarly life.6\n6 R.

Voltaire and Rousseau were literally exhumed and reburied at the Panthéon7 and a variety of symbolic and institutional rebirths remade the French state. In that context, both revolutionary and post-Revolutionary Napoleonic governments sought to remake the academy, along with the rest of society.\n7 Talj Gordon Tatum, Panthéonizations and Exhumations : Ceremonial Reburials in Revolutionary France., 2016, https://hdl.handle.net/2104/9800.\n\n\n\nThe Panthéon of Paris in 1795; image by Jean Baptiste Hilaire\n\n\n\nFrench natural history, with Georges Cuvier as a leading scholar, focused on systematizing knowledge of past and present lifeforms and he turned its categorizing gaze upon humans as well, proposing a three-part, hierarchical racial schema (Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian) with multipe sub-branches.
