He is the principal investigator of Ultimate Consequences, a digital archive on death in Bolivian political conflict, and author of The Sovereign Street: Making Revolution in Urban Bolivia. He is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and of Law at Vanderbilt University.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, he conducted ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews on social movements, race and space, protest tactics, and political change in Cochabamba, Sucre, and La Paz, resulting in a monograph, The Sovereign Street, and articles including “Binding Leaders to the Community” (Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 2018), “Race and the Right to Speak for the City: Political Violence in Bolivia’s 2006–2009 Stalemate” (UAS, 2019), “Unarmed Militancy” (American Anthropologist, 2020). Using both anthropological and historical methods, The Sovereign Street explores how pivotal public events generate political legitimacy, contribute to major (sometimes revolutionary) transformations in the balance of power, and provide models for future political action. The ethnographic evidence collected about these events—of social life as experienced through the human body, the meanings attached to places, and social movement practices—explains how grassroots movements exert leverage upon the state through protest.\nUltimate Consequences is a quantitative and qualitative database, unique in its depth and completeness of coverage, of all conflict deaths in Bolivia since October 1982. It is supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and a Digital Humanities Incubation Grant from Vanderbilt University. Drawing on the database, Prof. Bjork-James wrote an expert witness report for the plaintiffs in Mamani et al. v. Sánchez de Lozada et al., the first US Federal case to hold a head of state liable for human rights violations, and the white paper “Mass Protest and State Repression in Bolivian Political Culture” (Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, 2020). His published scholarship has addressed the evolving international human rights regime, social movement interventions into global governance, anti-indigenous racism and state violence in eastern Colombia, and socio-environmental conflicts and state environmental policy in the Andes.",

    "text": "For our final week together, we will be reading Gayle Rubin’s article “The Traffic in Women,” which offers a sophisticated analysis of the interconnection between social taboos, gender identity development, and compulsory heterosexuality, knitting these forces together into a composite “sex/gender system.” Drawing on but greatly extending prior Marxist work on kinship, Rubin proposes that this system functions prior to and alongside the economic sphere investigated by Marx and Engels. Like the economy, the sex/gender system can take multiple shapes over time, with collective action capable of overthrowing one system and instituting another. Rubin suggests (with some ambivalence) the term “patriarchy” to refer to the current dominant mode of the sex/gender system and urges that “Feminism must call for a revolution in kinship” (199).\nIn Rubin’s telling, gendered behavior, personalities, and marriage behaviors are all integrally related. The social drama of lineages exchanging women, suggested in Mauss’s The Gift and elaborated in Lévi-Strauss’ Elementary Structures of Kinship,,1 is at the heart of this story and the (de)formation of personalities into gendered expression is in in service of the exchange. Through gendered socialization, as explored by Mead (though “Traffic” doesn’t mention her directly), de Beauvoir, and (sometimes in faltering way) Freudian psychoanalytic perspectives on gender, women are transformed into give-able social objects.\nFollowing Freud’s theory of infantile sexuality as polymorphous, perverse, and un-differentiated by sex, Rubin narrates the imposition of sex-based personalities as a traumatic imposition (a “straightjacket,” she writes) on both genders. The transformation of this system she envisages would\nThere are solid Wikipedia articles on Gayle Rubin herself and on “The Traffic in Women.” Finally, Rubin offers an especially rich reflection on her writing in a 1994 interview with Judith Butler.2",

    "text": "Theoretical Influences\n\n\n\n\n\nA kinship diagram of theoretical influences on Gayle Rubin’s “The Traffic in Women”\n\n\nRubin draws on a truly remarkable number of theoretical referents, making “The Traffic in Women” into something of a theoretical crossroads. On the one hand, we have been tracing our way along many of these pathways, making us especially well-informed readers of this piece. On the other hand, there will be other threads that are unfamiliar. Don’t worry about just trusting Rubin’s account of these sources.\nNevertheless, if you want to follow some of these pathways yourself, here are some resources.\n\nThe Oedipus Complex\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Oedipus Complex” by Freud Museum London: The key thing to remember is it’s complex; it’s not an Oedipus simplex\n\n\nA just-enough video introduction to the Oedipus Complex from the Freud Museum London. The core takeaways are these: 1. While the existence of an Oedipal drama within every household may seem far-fetched, it is primarily a language for talking about permitted and forbidden attachment to parental figures; 2. Freudian theory posits that learning the social limits on one’s sexuality happens simultaneously with learning one’s gender identity; and 3. learning proper identity is a complex process that runs differently in each individual.\nA more complete walk-through of Freud’s theory of psychosexual development is in Lecture XXI of Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.3 Here is how #3 above is framed there:\n3 Sigmund Freud, Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis (Norton, 1977).\nFrom this time onwards, the human individual has to devote himself to the great task of detaching himself from his parents, and not until that task is achieved can he cease to be a child and become a member of the social community. … These tasks are set to everyone; and it is remarkable how seldom they are dealt with in an ideal manner - that is, in one which is correct both psychologically and socially.4\n4 Freud, Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis, 380–81.\n\n\nFreud, Lévi-Strauss, and Lacan on the Incest Prohibition and the Law\nIn Totem and Taboo,5 Freud describes the incest taboo as a historical event that helped to define civilization itself. In this book we find Freud engaging in armchair anthroplogy, and a version in which “savagery”, childhood, and neuroses all serve as analogues for one another. The individual Oedipal drama has a collective counterpart: the desire of the primal male horde to murder the tribal leader who monopolized women in the hypothetical community. The prohibition this murder is accomplished through instituting both law and religion. Here is a brief narration of that drama.\n5 Sigmund Freud, Totem and Taboo (Moffat, Yard, 1918), http://archive.org/details/freud-1918-totem-and-taboo.Lévi-Strauss takes up this Freudian story in Elementary Structures, but is emphatic that it is ahistorical. Instead the incest taboo itself becomes the necessary equivalent of any (and not just “civilized”) society. Lévi-Strauss’ enngament with Freud comes in Chapter XXIX.\nMeanwhile Lacan expands on the theme of the Law having its origin in the moment of Oedipal prohibition, or equivalently in the moment of encountering sex-linked expectations on one’s behavior: “The primordial Law is therefore that which in regulating marriage ties superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of a nature abandoned to the law of mating.”6 Much of what is often attributed to Lacan is present in the original writings by Freud and Daniel Hourigan does the deep dive on these themes.7\n6 Jacques Lacan, Alan Sheridan, and Malcolm Bowie, The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis (Routledge, 2001), 73.7 Daniel Hourigan, “Law on the Other Side of Oedipus: Freud and Lacan on Law and Self-Formation,” Law, Culture and the Humanities, April 24, 2024, 17438721241234195, https://doi.org/10.1177/17438721241234195.\n\nStructures of Kinship\nThis section is repeated from Week 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Although less important than those associated with funerals, the astonishing complexity of the matrimonial exchanges illustrated in Fig. 3 deserves to engage our attention.”\n\n\n8 Lévi-Strauss, The Elementary Structures of Kinship.In Elementary Structures of Kinship,8 Claude Lévi-Strauss proposes a structuralist explanation for the circulation of spouses mentioned in Mauss’s The Gift. The core insight of the book is to unite the near-universal taboo on incest (in some form) with the complex kinship structures that anthropologists had been mapping since at least Lewis Henry Morgan. (Like Douglas, he rejects the functionalist explanation that incest taboos prevent interbreeding.)\nLévi-Strauss argues that by separating marriageable from un-marriageable individuals, kinship systems generate the necessary boundaries for lineages that are the collective social actors which exchange spouses—glossed in his account, as in Mauss’s brief phrase, exclusively as women.\nGayle Rubin will build upon Elementary Structures of Kinship in her pivotal essay “The Traffic in Women,”9 which theorizes kinship and gender systems as integrated whole, subject to historical change, and as systems of power.\n9 Gayle Rubin, The Traffic in Women: Towards a Political Economy of Sex, ed. Rayna Reiterc (Monthly Review Press, 1975).\nAnd if men have been sexual subjects—exchangers—and women sexual semi-objects—gifts—for much of human history, then a great many customs, clichés, and personality traits seem to make a great deal of sense (among others, the curious custom by which a father gives away a bride).\n\nThis essay proves foundational to Gender Studies. Both Rubin and Judith Butler will bring vast inquiries into gender, the body, and sexuality into dialogue with Lévi-Strauss’ account.",

    "text": "The Gift\nMarcel Mauss wrote Essai sur le don (Essay on the Gift) as the main work of L’Année Sociologique of 1923/24. This brief, comparative work is his best known contribution to anthropology and one of the most widely cited anthropological works. As editor of the journal, co-author of multiple works, and as chair of Sociology at the College de France, was key to the growth of social anthropology in France. (And is even credited by Claude Lévi-Strauss with importing the term social anthropology into France.1)\n1 Claude Levi-Strauss, “The Scope of Anthropology,” Current Anthropology 7, no. 2 (1966): 112–23, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2740021.Mauss’s essay reoriented the anthropological study of the circulation of goods, intangible offerings, services, and honors in multiple ways. It widened the scope of “stuff” considered possible to exchange, sets up social collectivities (and also deities) rather than individuals as the participants in these exchanges, recognizes that that which is exchanged is charged with spiritual power, explains that this system morally demands reciprocity, and argues that such reciprocity is the foundation of social relations.\n\nAll these institutions reveal the same kind of social and! psychological pattern. Food, women, children, possessions, charms, land, labour, services, religious offices, rank—every- thing is stuff to be given away and repaid. In perpetual interchange of what we may call spiritual matter, comprising men and things, these elements pass and repass between clans ^and individuals, ranks, sexes and generations.2\n2 Marcel Mauss, The Gift; Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies., trans. Ian Cunnison and E. E. Evans-Pritchard (Free Press, 1954), 11–12.\nThe essay appears within a journal (L’Année Sociologique) that Mauss was resurrecting following World War I and the death of both his uncle and mentor Émile Durkheim and many of his scholarly peers. The entire issue is included in the 2016 translation by Jane Guyer, published by the anthropological collective Hau, which in turn owes its name to the Polynesian concept as explored in the essay.\nSpecifically Māori culture occupies a turning point in the essay, one partly grounded on misinterpretation between anthropologist Elsdon Best and Māori informant and scholarl Tamati Ranapati. Georgina Stewart has critically examined the relationship and the multiple points of cultural communication, miscommunication, and supposition that culminate in “the hau of the gift” as conceptualized by Mauss.\n\nRanapiri was inventing Māori academic writing as he wrote: writing about and in language that hitherto had existed only in oral registers. Other than Ranapiri, only one other scholar of Māori ethnicity, namely Biggs, appears in the history of debate about the hau of the gift.\n\n\nMauss failed to account for the personified Māori cosmos, and ended up invalidly personifying ‘hau’ instead, in his delineation of ‘hau taonga’ as the ‘hau of the gift’—the ‘spirit’ of the object given. In this way, Mauss distorted the Māori concept of hau to serve his preconceived search for universal social truth, and a general theory of exchange.3\n3 Georgina Stewart, “The ‘Hau’of Research: Mauss Meets Kaupapa māori,” Journal of World Philosophies 2, no. 1 (2017), https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iupjournals/index.php/jwp/article/view/917.\nAmber Nicholson likewise explores the Māori concept of hau in depth using numerous Māori sources.4 In my view, this rich exposition breaks with some anthropological elaborations on the term (which Nicholson maps out in a dramatic side-by-side table with Māori ideas), but still resonates with the concepts of spiritual force, reciprocity, and enmeshment in larger entities emphasized by Mauss.\n4 Amber Nicholson, “Hau: Giving Voices to the Ancestors,” The Journal of the Polynesian Society 128, no. 2 (2019): 137–62, https://www.jstor.org/stable/26857338.There have been three English translations of The Gift:\n\nA 1954 translation by Ian Cunnison, introduced by E. E. Evans-Pritchard.5\nA 1990 translation by W. D. Halls, introduced by Mary Douglas.6\nA 2016 translation by Jane I. Guyer, introduced by Guyer and Bill Maurer.7\n\n5 Mauss, The Gift; Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies.6 Marcel Mauss, The gift: the form and reason for exchange in archaic societies, Routledge classics (Routledge, 2002).7 Marcel Mauss, The gift: Expanded edition, Expanded edition. (HAU Books, 2016).The Gift is written in the tradition of an open-ended essay, and draws many threads across a remarkable sweep of time and geography. This comment from Claude Lévi-Strauss emphasizes the creative and connective, rather than scientific and deductive aspect of such writing:\n\nWithout a doubt, the proof will remain largely illusory: we will never know if the other, with whom we cannot, after all, identify, makes from the elements of his social existence a synthesis exactly superposable on that which we have worked out. But it is not necessary to go so far; all that is needed-and for this, inner feeling is sufficient-is that the synthesis, how- ever approximate, arises from human experience. We must be sure of this, since we study men; and as we are ourselves men, we have that possibility. The way in which Mauss (1950:285) poses and resolves the problem in the Essay on the Gift brings to view, in the intersection of two subjectivities, the nearest order of truth to which the sciences of man can aspire when they confront the wholeness of their object.8\n8 Levi-Strauss, “The Scope of Anthropology,” 114.\nWith that said, The Gift attacks and perhaps overthrows many prior certainties in anthropological studies of the economy, not least of which is the refutation of the existence of a “free gift,” as highlighted in Mary Douglas’s introduction. Think about which ones you find.\n\n\nOn Boundaries: Purity and Danger\nMary Douglas’s Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo9 stands as a historical landmark in the anthropology of religion.\n9 Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An analysis of concept of pollution and taboo, 1st ed. (Routledge, 1966), https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203361832.A signature phrase in it is “matter out of place,” Douglas’ definition of the otherwise form-shifting concept of dirt. She sets up categorization and boundary drawing as a core element of religion. Given this, one need not think of the Kosher laws in Leviticus as primitive hygenic codes, nor of magical incantations as ways of causing miracles.  Rather, she argues, both express ritual concern with maintaining social order.Douglas revises her specific interpretations of Kosher practices in her 2002 introduction.1010 Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concept of Pollution and Taboo (Routledge, 2003), http://www.dawsonera.com/depp/reader/protected/external/AbstractView/S9780203361832.\n\nIt is only by exaggerating the difference between within and without, above and below, male and female, with and against, that a semblance of order is created.\n\nHer chapter on magic and religion confronts and challenges the line of anthropological scholarship on “primitive religion” going back to James Frazer’s The Golden Bough.\n\n\nStructures of Kinship\n\n\n\n\n\n“Although less important than those associated with funerals, the astonishing complexity of the matrimonial exchanges illustrated in Fig. 3 deserves to engage our attention.”\n\n\n11 Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Elementary Structures of Kinship, Rev. ed. (Beacon Press, 1969).In Elementary Structures of Kinship,11 Claude Lévi-Strauss proposes a structuralist explanation for the circulation of spouses mentioned in Mauss’s The Gift.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The two ethnographic works we’re reading this week are Bronislaw Malinowski’s Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922) and Max Gluckman’s article “Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand” (widely known as “The Bridge,” 1940). The two works make foundational methodological claims for how to do ethnography, but their foci are sharply different. Malinowski’s Argonauts would become a canonical text for fieldwork through participant observation, while Gluckman’s article is a landmark in the development of power-aware situational analysis.\n\nMalinowski’s Argonauts of the Western Pacific\n\n\n\nA photo (Plate I) from Malinowski’s Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922), showing the native village as well as Malinowski’s tent\n\n\nBronisław Malinowski (), a native of Krakow, received his doctorate there, only turning his attention to anthropology at that time, inspired by James Frazer’s The Golden Bough. He worked at the London School of Ecoonomics from 1910 and late in his life at Yale University.\nIt’s difficult to underestimate either the influence of Malinowski on the traditions of anthropological fieldwork or the broad impact of his students on mid-century social anthropology, which parallels that of Boas’ students in the United States. Among his students were E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Raymond Firth, Meyer Fortes, and Edmund Leach, each noted for their contributions to mid-century anthropological theory. Jomo Kenyatta studied social anthropology with Malinowski and crafted his essays on his Kikuyu people into the book Facing Mount Kenya (1938),1 which also stands as an indictment of British colonial misunderstandings of Kenyan society. Kenyatta returned to his native land in 1947, led the Kenyan African Union, and became the first president of Kenya until his death in 1978.\n1 Jomo Kenyatta, Facing Mount Kenya: the tribal life of the Gikuyu (Secker; Warburg, 1953), https://archive.org/details/facingmountkenya0000jomo_k4y6/page/n9/mode/2up.2 Vine. Deloria, Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto (Macmillan Company, 1969), 78–100.It’s remarkable how Malinowski’s argument for theoretically informed fieldwork in Argonauts is mirrored by Vine Deloria’s polemic2 against anthropologists in Native American communities who are concerned with theoretical questions rather than the practical problems of their research subjects.\nIn Argonauts, Malinowski also outlines a three-part vision for anthropological writing and data collection: (1) systematic data on a tribe’s organization and cultural forms; (2) elegant writing on “the imponderabilia of actual life” and behavior as recorded in ethnographic diaries; and (3) a corpus of native-language statements, myths, magical formula, and narratives. These lines of evidence converge in Malinowski’s widely cited statement of purpose for ethnography:\n\nThese three lines of approach lead to the final goal, of which an Ethnographer should never lose sight. This goal is, briefly, to grasp the native’s point of view, his relation to life, to realise his vision of his world. We have to study man, and we must study what concerns him most intimately, that is, the hold which life has on him. In each culture, the values are slightly different; people aspire after substance of their happiness—is, in my opinion, to miss the greatest reward different aims, follow different impulses, yearn after a different form of happiness. In each culture, we find different institutions in which man pursues his life-interest, different customs by which he satisfies his aspirations, different codes of law and morality which reward his virtues or punish his defections. To study the institutions, customs, and codes or to study the behaviour and mentality without the subjective desire of feeling by what these people live, of realising the which we can hope to obtain from the study of man.\n\n\n\nGluckman’s “Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand”\n\nMax Gluckman () was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1911. Gluckman studied anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg under Winifred Hoernlé and I. Schapera. He would later describe this training as part of the “sociological stream” of anthropology, which he traced upstream to those scholar’s teacher, Alfred “A.R.” Radcliffe-Brown, and through him to Emile Durkheim.3 His doctoral work in anthropology at Oxford brought him into direct contact with Radcliffe-Brown as well as E. E. Evans-Pritchard and solidified his attachment to social anthropology as his intellectual home.\n3 Max Gluckman, Order and Rebellion in Tribal Societies (Cohen & West, 1963), 2.4 Gluckman Max, The Kingdom of the Zulu of South Africa, 1st ed. (Routledge, 1987), 2555, https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315683461-2.Gluckman traces his own intellectual biography in detail in an introductory essay to Order and Rebellion in Tribal Africa. After completing his doctorate, Gluckman returned to South Africa to conduct fieldwork among the Zulu people of Natal. His article written in the field, “The Kingdom of the Zulu in South Africa” considers 120 years of Zulu history from the nation’s founding by Shaka Zulu in 1818-24. The focus is within the Zulu Nation, but is on turbulent processes of political change through rebellions that nonetheless maintain the nation and its monarchy. Gluckman considers the Zulu people’s relationships to the British colonial power as part of this history.4\nHowever, his article “Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand” (1940),5 commonly referred to as “The Bridge,” casts the largest shadow on broader anthropology, precisely because it re-conceptualizes the colonial society in South Africa as a single biracial society and because it introduced an approach to situational analysis that tacks betweeen specific events and the broader social structure. In effect, Gluckman imports the concept of segmentary society, previously applied to complex African polities to the colonial situation of racially stratified power in South Africa.\n5 Max Gluckman, Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand (Published on behalf of the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute by the Manchester University Press, 1958).Gluckman’s approach shifts the framing of anthropology from “the Native” society to the social world that includes the anthropologist him or herself, the colonial government, missionaries, employers, and the entire complex power structure. At root is consideration of what we now call “his own subject position” and a kind of narration later termed “reflexivity.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“White men in front – prepared to leave for Nongoma,” 2012 painting by Linda Bjørnskov from her solo exhibition “The Whispering of Max Gluckman’s Bridge Paper”\n\n\n\nObviously many difficulties beset an anthropologist in this situation, especially if he comes to study race-relationships themselves. He cannot walk around asking about these and his presence always disturbs the people. I did not drop as an isolated individual into Zulu life, recording with superior impartiality what I observed. I came as a White – and the Zulu had to fit me in as an eccentric and highly suspect member of the dominant White group. As a White, I was a “chief” and that created about me latent political power. I early became conscious of attempts by the Zulu to use me for their own advantage and to play me against both Black and White personalities. … My later data on general White-Zulu relationships shows that what happened to me was not the unique result of my character and views, though it was affected by these, but crystallized the form of Zululand social structure itself. — Max Gluckman, “Conflict and Cohesion in Zululand: An Historical Study in Social Organization,” unpublished manuscript written c. 1946.6\n6 Robert J. Gordon and H. Max Gluckman, “On Burning One’s Bridge: The Context of Gluckman’s Zulu Fieldwork: With the Previously Unpublished Chapter “the Research Situation” (Circa 1946),” History in Africa 41 (2014): 183, https://www.jstor.org/stable/26362088.\nSome amazing context for Max Gluckman’s “The Bridge” article is offered in Robert Gordon’s “On Burning One’s Bridge: The Context of Gluckman’s Zulu Fieldwork,”7 to which is appended Gluckman’s unpublished note that is quoted above. Here is its suggestive abstract:\n7 Gordon and Gluckman, “On Burning One’s Bridge.”\nAbstract: Gluckman’s 1940 essay “An Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand” (aka as “The Bridge”) is widely acknowledged as one of the most influ- ential in social anthropology for signalling a paradigm shift. This paper publishes a chapter of a previously unpublished, undated manuscript by Gluckman – probably from 1946 – describing how he did fieldwork in Zululand. A contextualizing essay discusses why Gluckman went to Zululand, what his preparations were, how he famously got “banned,” the role of the regent and the native commissioners in orchestrating this, and how local anti-semitism also played its part. It also suggests that his “banning,” coupled to his marriage in 1939 to Mary Brignoli, a member of the communist party, were crucial factors leading to this paradigm change. Finally, the afterlife of “The Bridge” is sketched showing how dismal was its original reception among peers and colleagues.",

    "text": "This week’s readings attempt to capture anthropological thinking at the moment when Enlightenment thought is seeding the formation of the modern research university. While it will take some further decades for “the science of man” to escape from Natural History and take its place alongside other social scientific disciplines in the Western Academy, essential foundation for all three of these elements in that story (anthropology, the research university, and the social sciences) were all being laid around 1800.\nThis larger story is the reason why we return to Eric Wolf’s “Introduction” to Europe and the People Without History1 this week. Wolf’s book attempts a six-century account of global processes in which both colonizing and colonized societies were radically transformed and his introduction make the theoretical case that the often-presumed object of anthropological study, distinct “traditional societies,” each with their own “culture,” is an illusion.\n1 Eric R. Wolf, Introduction (Univ. of California Press, 1982).\nBy turning names into things we create false models of reality. By endowing nations, societies, or cultures with the qualities of internally homogeneous and externally distinctive and bounded objects, we create a model of the world as a global pool hall in which the entities spin off each other like so many hard and round billiard balls. Thus it becomes easy to sort the world into differently colored balls… (6)\n\nRelevantly for this week, Wolf describes “The Rise of the Social Sciences” in an argument which is more of an intellectual lament than a chronological account. For Wolf, sociology, political science, and economics are incomplete disciplines, which artificially sever certain relationships from the broader whole, most crucially by failing to take an integrated look at political economy. He notes that sociology was initially a political project aimed at fostering social cohesion (on this point, see more directly Mostajir2), and that political science and economics have been oriented around formal models of their spheres of interest that leave out that which is crucial.\n2 Parysa Mostajir, Social Physics, Industrialization, and the French Revolution, n.d., https://voices.uchicago.edu/pmostajir/2020/10/19/history-of-social-science-lecture-4-social-science-industrialization-and-the-french-revolution/.3 Immanuel Kant, “Beantwortung Der Frage: Was Ist Aufklärung?” Berlinische Monatsschrift, December 1784.4 Immanuel Kant, Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, 1799.5 Michel Foucault, What Is Enlightenment?, n.d., https://foucault.info/documents/foucault.whatIsEnlightenment.en/.All of this separation and stratification has taken place in the context of the modern research university, that entity that emerged in the 19th century as states worked to formalize the space of intellectual inquiry demanded by Enlightenment thinkers. In the readings these are represented by Immanuel Kant’s essay, “What is Enlightenment?”34 and the commentary on it by Michel Foucault.5 Without denying that the state is due the obedience of the public, Kant urges the right to freedom of argument.\nThe devastating invasions by Republican and Napoleonic France taught a stinging lesson to the still-divided German-speaking realms, and “counter-Enlightenment” reforms of society included the creation of new academic, military, and state institutions. Germany’s Humboldtian universities set out the basic contours of modern academic life: tenure, freedom of thought for professors, unity of research and teaching, and isolation from non-scholarly life.6\n6 R.

    "text": "“Anthropology, as it was practiced throughout much of the 19th century,” writes Rachel Caspari, “was a single biocultural discipline, with race linking the components.”1 Even though the nineteenth century saw a tremendous intellectual revolution in human biology—the introduction of a formal understanding of evolution—the foundational role of race remained unshaken, even reinforced, by this change.\n1 Rachel Caspari, “From Types to Populations: A Century of Race, Physical Anthropology, and the American Anthropological Association,” American Anthropologist 105, no. 1 (2003): 65–76.This week’s readings center three forms of evolutionary thinking in nineteenth century anthropology, which were tied together in the minds of their advocates: cultural evolution through stages of savagery, barbarism, and civilization; biological evolution of species (and it was presumed, races); and “social Darwinism” to describe the relative success of nations and classes.\nStefanos Gerlounas describes the nineteenth century as a time of three-stage theories of human pre/history, embraced across the century by Comte, Spencer, Tylor, Morgan, Marx, Engels, and Frazer. Lewis Henry Morgan’s Ancient Society2 and Edward Burnett Tylor’s Primitive Culture3 both make the same intellectual move, situating contemporary “savage” cultures as living fossils of a prior “primitive” era in human history, through which “barbarian” and “civilized’ peoples had already passed:\n2 Lewis H Morgan, Ancient Society, or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization (Charles H Kerr And Company, 1877), http://archive.org/details/ancientsociety035004mbp.3 Edward Burnett Tylor, Primitive culture: Researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom (Murray, 1920), http://archive.org/details/primitiveculture01tylouoft.\nThe thesis which I venture to sustain, within limits, is simply this, that the savage state in some measure represents an early condition of mankind, out of which the! higher culture has gradually been developed or evolved, by processes still in regular operation as of old, the result showing that, on the whole, progress has far prevailed over! relapse. (Tylor, p. 32)\nThe remote ancestors of the Aryan nations presumptively passed through an experience similar to that of existing barbarous and savage tribes. Though the experience of these nations embodies all the information necessary to illustrate the periods of civilization, both ancient and modern. (Morgan)\n\nEnglish professor Patrick Brantlinger is concerned with the rhetoric of extinction attached to Indigenous peoples worldwide by European writers, scientific and otherwise. These discourses were both certain of the impending extinction of savage peoples, and if trouble by it, only troubled from a scientific point of view. Brantlinger argues that these views were generally dismissive:\n\nWith a few exceptions—Lewis Henry Morgan and Alfred Russel Wallace are perhaps the main ones—most evolutionists treat primitive races and cultures negatively, not only as doomed by the inexorable laws of nature but also as meriting their pending extinctions. (165)\n\nDark Vanishings incorporates a wide range of nineteenth century anthropologists including: Thomas Jefferson (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1787); Albert Gallatin (Synopsis of the Indian Tribes of North America, 1836; founder of the American Ethnological Society, 1842) Henry Schoolcraft (The American Indians, Their History, Condition and Prospects); Samuel Morton (Crania Americana, 1839); Lewis Henry Morgan (League of the Iroquois, 1854); Josiah Nott and George Glidden (Types of Mankind, 1854),\nWe find in Brantlinger a surprising combination of salvage ethnography and celebration of savage demise. While making the case for “keep[ing] some scientific record of that which we destroy”, Pitt-Rivers sees no place for actual native peoples in the future other than in chains: “the savage is morally and mentally an unfit instrument for the spread of civilization, except when, like the higher mammal, he is reduced to slavery; his occupation is gone, and his place is required for an improved race.”\n\nFor broader views of American anthropology during this period, consider the earliest chapter in Lee Baker’s From Savage to Negro;4 Glynn Custred in A History of Anthropology As a Holistic Science;5 and many segments of David Hurst Thomas’ Skull Wars.6\n4 Lee D Baker, From Savage to Negro: Anthropology and the Construction of Race, 1896-1954 (University of California Press, 1998).5 Glynn Custred, Anthropology in the Nineteenth Century (Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2017).6 David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity (Basic Books, 2002).\n\n\n\nMutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution in its 2021 “Illuminated” edition\n\n\n7 Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man (Archives at NCBS, 1901), http://archive.org/details/ncbs.BB-001_0_0_0_1.\nDarwin, whose 1859 On the Origin of Species laid out the overall case for biological evolution, delayed direct consideration of the relationship of human to other animals for The Descent of Man, published in 1871.7 While Darwin presumes significant differences among “the races of man” and devotes a chapter to the topic, the text presumes a common human ancestor to all these racial groups and argues forcefully for the species’ overall closeness with primates in particular and animals in general. Nonetheless, racial groups and racial stereotypes are part of the evidentiary landscape used throughout.\nDarwin gives priority to organisms’ struggle for survival under conditions of scarcity (the primary form of natural selection in Origin), and secondary consideration to differential rates of reproduction as determined by competition for mates (theorized in Descent). Less considered by Darwin are competitions among groups and species themselves, which would more readily include tendencies towards communication, cooperation, and (a certain form of) altruism.\nThe first, more competitive form of natural selection became the basis for so-called social Darwinism, framed as “survival of the fittest” and associated with sociologist Herbert Spencer as well as founding eugenicist Francis Galton.\nA radically distinct view of natural behavior is presented by Pyotr (“Peter”) Kropotkin in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. Kropotkin highlights a wide variety of examples of cooperative behavior among animals (and plants), as well as human at each level of the social evolutionary ladder. While the subject of much skepticism initially, Kropotkin’s overall ideas overlap with Darwin’s, and mutualism within species is taken seriously as a factor in interspecies competition and macroevolution by current biologists.\nStephen Jay Gould (2000:471) even argues that Kropotkin and Darwin’s different emphases stem from their research environments: “In fact, Kropotkin, who was well trained in biology, spoke for a Russian consensus in arguing that density-independent regulation by occasional, but severe, environmental stress will tend to encourage intraspecific cooperation as a mode of natural selection. The harsh environments of the vast Russian steppes and tundras often elicited such a generalized belief; Kropotkin and colleagues had observed well in a local context, but had erred in over generalization. But Darwin and Wallace, schooled in the … tropics, may have made an equally parochial error in advocating such a dominant role for biotic struggle over limited resources in crowded space.”8\n8 Stephen Jay Gould, The structure of evolutionary theory (Belknap Press, 2002).9 Gould, The structure of evolutionary theory.10 Michael Tomasello, Why We Cooperate, A Boston Review Book (The MIT Press, 2009), https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=88bf887e-e045-30b0-a60f-4a9cca13578a.11 David Sloan Wilson, Does Altruism Exist? : Culture, Genes, and the Welfare of Others, Foundational Questions in Science (Yale University Press, 2014), https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ff9db0f7-14f2-3c57-bb76-19f6ba1dcd7f.For recent summaries of species-level cooperation and mutualism, see paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould’s chapter on “Species as Individuals in the Hierachical Theory of Selection”;9 primatologist Michael Tomasello’s Why We Cooperate;10 and David Sloan Wilson’s Does Altruism Exist?.11",

    "section": "Historical context of the Ghost Dance",
    "text": "Historical context of the Ghost Dance\nThe colonization of the Great Plains through the Indian Wars is the context for the spread of the Ghost Dance religion. The Fort Laramie Treaties had recognized native sovereignty over the Great Plains in 1851, but volunteer and Federal Army troops began a new round of Indian Wars in the 1860s. Genocidal massacres, military internment, and the undermining of the Indian food supply followed in the succeeding decades. Killing buffalo as a tactic of counterinsurgency was pursued with abandon, as praised by General Philip Sheridan in 1875:\n\nThese men [the buffalo hunters] have done … more to settle the vexed Indian question than the entire regular army has done in the last 30 years. They are destroying the Indians’ commissary. … Send them powder and lead if you will, but for the sake of lasting peace let them kill, skin, and sell until the buffalo are exterminated.1\n1 Quoted in Winona LaDuke, All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life (South End Press, 1999), 141.\nThese measures constituted successive attacks on the physical and cultural mechanisms of survival of the Indians. And consciously so, as can be seen from the opinion of General William Tecumseh Sherman as early as 1867, “We must act with vindictive earnestness against the [Lakota], even to their extermination, men, women and children.”.2 The impact was devastating, as Dee Brown describes for the summer of 1874,\n2 Ward Churchill, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas, 1492 to the Present (City Lights, 1997), 240.\nIf such a season [of drought] had come upon this land a few years earlier, a thunder of a million buffalo hooves would have shaken the prairie in frantic stampedes for water. But now the herds were gone, replaced by an endless desolation of bones and skulls and rotting hooves. … Bands of Comanches, Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arapahos roamed restlessly, finding a few small herds, but many had to return to their reservations to keep from starving.3\n3 Dee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West, Thirtieth Anniversary ed. (H. Holt, 2001), 268.\nThose who chose the path of a negotiated surrender to reservations, as did those led by Sitting Bull in 1881, saw agreements for rations and safety undermined. Just two years after that agreement, Sitting Bull—noting “our rations have been reduced to almost nothing” and “many of our people have starved to death”—made a plea for material equality as a corollary of negotiation:\n\nYou white men advise us to follow your ways, and therefore I talk as I do. When you have a piece of land, and anyone trespasses on it, you catch them, and keep them until you get damages, and I am doing the same thing now…. I see my people starving, and I want the Great Father to make an increase in the amount of food that is allowed us now, so that they may be able to live. We want cattle to butcher—I want to kill 300 head of cattle at a time. That is the way you live and we want to live the same way.4\n4 LaDuke, All Our Relations, 97.\nNotwithstanding their pleas, more than one-third of the Lakota would die of starvation and disease between 1877 and 1890.5 The self-sufficiency of the Indians of the Great Plains was undermined on the terrain of physical survival, through the imposition of facts on the ground.\n5 LaDuke, All Our Relations, 97.Here is my recorded lecture segment on the historical context of the Ghost Dance:\n{{&lt;video https://youtu.be/dCuBskJzLo4 &gt;}}\nAnthropologist Ella Deloria featured an eyewitness account of the Ghost Dance from an elder who a child during the peak of the religion.",

Neither destruction by gun fire and sacking of the labor confederation headquarters nor deadly fire into crowds of militants gathered before it have broken the general strike. So far the Natusch regime’s appallingly indiscriminate firing at civilians has had the opposite of the intended effect. Resistance of the militants has been steeled and the most common people are afraid to enter the inner city to take up their jobs.\n\n\n\nNegotiations between Natusch and the Congress continue. But in the end no compromise between civilian democracy and the military right of Natusch is possible: they are incompatible forces.

If Natusch accepts a graceful out of almost any kind, he and his sort, given the killing they have caused, will be swept by a counteraction out of the country if not out of this world. There may, therefore, be no graceful out for Natusch and his right-wing band of officers. If he is deposed, it is more likely to come from within the military than from negotiations with the Congress. There remains the fear that these negotiations are not in good faith and are only part of Natusch’s efforts to hold off military pressures to unseat him. Yet so far the focal point for a military counter move has not appeared.\n\n\n\nThe good officers are appalled and in tears of mixed rage and sorrow over the killing of civilians and degradation of the military as a political and social force in Bolivia. Generals Padilla and Azero, Colonel Caioja and others have lost their jobs and staked their lives over bold public calls to get the military out of the city, Natusch out of the palace and civilian democracy restored. But the bulk of the military is still watching and waiting.\n\n\n\nWhether Natusch and his band leave tomorrow, next month or later, some awesome damage has already been done to Bolivia and its tortuous, but determined course to civilian, constitutional rule.\n\nThe fabric of military-civilian cooperation, so important to the democratic transition so far, has been rent by betrayal, blood and bitterness;\nThe fragile unity of the armed forces has been shattered by schisms of deep resentment and shame–and dissension in the armed forces has been the only serious threat to the peace that modern Bolivia has known;\nThe military has been disgraced and its ability to play a stabilizing, behind the scenes role damaged and perhaps destroyed;\nThe credibility in the eyes of the people of the moderate, civilian political parties has been shaken by the despicable instigating role in the coup of a handful of turncoats from the MNR and MNRI–Guillermo Bedregal, Jose Fellman Velarde, Edel Sandoval Moron and Abel Ayoroa Argandona.\n\n\n\n\nThe possible positive effects in the hangover from the Walpurgisnacht of the Right are meager or nil. Just perhaps the arrogant, paranoic right of the military will be purged after the bloody binge on which they have misled their institution, perhaps civilian politics will throw out or indict the quislings who viewed a bloodbath as a small price for a government job. But neither one may happen and both together would not justify perhaps 100 dead and many more wounded, nor the lasting damage to an open society and Bolivians confidence in each other or themselves.\nBOEKER\n\n\n\n\nDocument Number: 1979LAPAZ09512\nDate: 06 Nov 1979\nClassification: Confidential (EXDIS)\nDeclassified: 20 Mar 2014 (E.O.

    "text": "For our final week together, we will be reading Gayle Rubin’s article “The Traffic in Women,” which offers a sophisticated analysis of the interconnection between social taboos, gender identity development, and compulsory heterosexuality, knitting these forces together into a composite “sex/gender system.” Drawing on but greatly extending prior Marxist work on kinship, Rubin proposes that this system functions prior to and alongside the economic sphere investigated by Marx and Engels. Like the economy, the sex/gender system can take multiple shapes over time, with collective action capable of overthrowing one system and instituting another. Rubin suggests (with some ambivalence) the term “patriarchy” to refer to the current dominant mode of the sex/gender system and urges that “Feminism must call for a revolution in kinship” (199).\nIn Rubin’s telling, gendered behavior, personalities, and marriage behaviors are all integrally related. The social drama of lineages exchanging women, suggested in Mauss’s The Gift and elaborated in Lévi-Strauss’ Elementary Structures of Kinship,,1 is at the heart of this story and the (de)formation of personalities into gendered expression is in in service of the exchange. Through gendered socialization, as explored by Mead (though “Traffic” doesn’t mention her directly), de Beauvoir, and (sometimes in faltering way) Freudian psychoanalytic perspectives on gender, women are transformed into give-able social objects.\nFollowing Freud’s theory of infantile sexuality as polymorphous, perverse, and un-differentiated by sex, Rubin narrates the imposition of sex-based personalities as a traumatic imposition (a “straightjacket,” she writes) on both genders. The transformation of this system she envisages would\nThere are solid Wikipedia articles on Gayle Rubin herself and on “The Traffic in Women.” Finally, Rubin offers an especially rich reflection on her writing in a 1994 interview with Judith Butler.2",

    "text": "Theoretical Influences\n\n\n\n\n\nA kinship diagram of theoretical influences on Gayle Rubin’s “The Traffic in Women”\n\n\nRubin draws on a truly remarkable number of theoretical referents, making “The Traffic in Women” into something of a theoretical crossroads. On the one hand, we have been tracing our way along many of these pathways, making us especially well-informed readers of this piece. On the other hand, there will be other threads that are unfamiliar. Don’t worry about just trusting Rubin’s account of these sources.\nNevertheless, if you want to follow some of these pathways yourself, here are some resources.\n\nThe Oedipus Complex\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Oedipus Complex” by Freud Museum London: The key thing to remember is it’s complex; it’s not an Oedipus simplex\n\n\nA just-enough video introduction to the Oedipus Complex from the Freud Museum London. The core takeaways are these: 1. While the existence of an Oedipal drama within every household may seem far-fetched, it is primarily a language for talking about permitted and forbidden attachment to parental figures; 2. Freudian theory posits that learning the social limits on one’s sexuality happens simultaneously with learning one’s gender identity; and 3. learning proper identity is a complex process that runs differently in each individual.\nA more complete walk-through of Freud’s theory of psychosexual development is in Lecture XXI of Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis.3 Here is how #3 above is framed there:\n3 Sigmund Freud, Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis (Norton, 1977).\nFrom this time onwards, the human individual has to devote himself to the great task of detaching himself from his parents, and not until that task is achieved can he cease to be a child and become a member of the social community. … These tasks are set to everyone; and it is remarkable how seldom they are dealt with in an ideal manner - that is, in one which is correct both psychologically and socially.4\n4 Freud, Introductory lectures on psychoanalysis, 380–81.\n\n\nFreud, Lévi-Strauss, and Lacan on the Incest Prohibition and the Law\nIn Totem and Taboo,5 Freud describes the incest taboo as a historical event that helped to define civilization itself. In this book we find Freud engaging in armchair anthroplogy, and a version in which “savagery”, childhood, and neuroses all serve as analogues for one another. The individual Oedipal drama has a collective counterpart: the desire of the primal male horde to murder the tribal leader who monopolized women in the hypothetical community. The prohibition this murder is accomplished through instituting both law and religion. Here is a brief narration of that drama.\n5 Sigmund Freud, Totem and Taboo (Moffat, Yard, 1918), http://archive.org/details/freud-1918-totem-and-taboo.Lévi-Strauss takes up this Freudian story in Elementary Structures, but is emphatic that it is ahistorical. Instead the incest taboo itself becomes the necessary equivalent of any (and not just “civilized”) society. Lévi-Strauss’ enngament with Freud comes in Chapter XXIX.\nMeanwhile Lacan expands on the theme of the Law having its origin in the moment of Oedipal prohibition, or equivalently in the moment of encountering sex-linked expectations on one’s behavior: “The primordial Law is therefore that which in regulating marriage ties superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of a nature abandoned to the law of mating.”6 Much of what is often attributed to Lacan is present in the original writings by Freud and Daniel Hourigan does the deep dive on these themes.7\n6 Jacques Lacan, Alan Sheridan, and Malcolm Bowie, The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis (Routledge, 2001), 73.7 Daniel Hourigan, “Law on the Other Side of Oedipus: Freud and Lacan on Law and Self-Formation,” Law, Culture and the Humanities, April 24, 2024, 17438721241234195, https://doi.org/10.1177/17438721241234195.\n\nStructures of Kinship\nThis section is repeated from Week 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Although less important than those associated with funerals, the astonishing complexity of the matrimonial exchanges illustrated in Fig. 3 deserves to engage our attention.”\n\n\n8 Lévi-Strauss, The Elementary Structures of Kinship.In Elementary Structures of Kinship,8 Claude Lévi-Strauss proposes a structuralist explanation for the circulation of spouses mentioned in Mauss’s The Gift. The core insight of the book is to unite the near-universal taboo on incest (in some form) with the complex kinship structures that anthropologists had been mapping since at least Lewis Henry Morgan. (Like Douglas, he rejects the functionalist explanation that incest taboos prevent interbreeding.)\nLévi-Strauss argues that by separating marriageable from un-marriageable individuals, kinship systems generate the necessary boundaries for lineages that are the collective social actors which exchange spouses—glossed in his account, as in Mauss’s brief phrase, exclusively as women.\nGayle Rubin will build upon Elementary Structures of Kinship in her pivotal essay “The Traffic in Women,”9 which theorizes kinship and gender systems as integrated whole, subject to historical change, and as systems of power.\n9 Gayle Rubin, The Traffic in Women: Towards a Political Economy of Sex, ed. Rayna Reiterc (Monthly Review Press, 1975).\nAnd if men have been sexual subjects—exchangers—and women sexual semi-objects—gifts—for much of human history, then a great many customs, clichés, and personality traits seem to make a great deal of sense (among others, the curious custom by which a father gives away a bride).\n\nThis essay proves foundational to Gender Studies. Both Rubin and Judith Butler will bring vast inquiries into gender, the body, and sexuality into dialogue with Lévi-Strauss’ account.\nPermalink: https://carwilb.github.io/teaching/history-anthro-w14.html",

    "text": "Margaret Mead’s generation lived through the most rapid period of change in human history, before or since. People born in 1901, like her, had entered world that was still lit by candles, gas lamps, and kerosene lanterns a world in which heavier-than-air flight was reckoned “a vain fantasy,” China was an ancient dynastic empire, the British Empire covered nearly one fourth of the planet’s land area, no nation allowed women to vote, and hundreds of thousands still carried the living memory of being enslaved. And the youthful, utopian Margaret Mead of the 1920s and 1930s had been almost unique in predicting the scope of the changes to come. While her peers continued to imagine the future as one dominated by Western empires and by traditional social norms, she predicted an age of upheaval that would alter the experience of being human itself—an era of transformed consciousness. —Benjamin Breen1\n1 Benjamin Breen, Tripping on utopia: Margaret Mead, the Cold War, and the troubled birth of psychedelic science, First edition. (Grand Central Publishing, Hachette Book Group, 2024), 266.\nMargaret Mead already had her PhD in hand when she traveled across the United States (by train with Ruth Benedict) and then further from San Francisco to Honolulu and onward to Samoa in 1925. Her fieldwork there on adolescent sexuality, published in Coming of Age in Samoa2 generated extensive publicity and launched her career as a public intellectual. Her subsequent work in Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies3 profiled three New Guinea cultures with distinct gender systems, and explored the question of what happens when an individual’s emotional disposition is at odd’s with society’s gender expectations.\nMead’s social relevance and ultimately the popularity of her work is largely a product of her ability to present ethnographic conclusions as relevant to American society, rather than a collection of curiosities that describe peoples seen as primitive and lesser. We can see in this an intellectual move to position ethnographic expertise as a resource for understanding all human societies, including her own. However, it’s also worth taking the time to read Mead’s latter chapters of these works as ethnographic treatment’s of Western culture in their own right.\nAt the start of World War II, Mead joined in a group of four anthropologists – Ruth Benedict, Gregory Bateson, and Geoffrey Gorer – in the Committee for National Morale. “From the first we felt it was only a matter of time before this country would be drawn into the conflict, and we hoped to put our growing knowledge of the human sciences at the services of the Allied fight against Nazism.” Mead’s main contribution was And Keep Your Powder Dry. In her introduction to a 1965 reprint, Mead looked back both on her practice of writing about Western culture in the final chapters of her previous books and on the sudden challenge of constructing an ethnographic description of her own culture.\nMead’s early work in Samoa ad New Guinea became the subject of a series of controversies, most visibly Derek Freeman’s 1983 Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth. However, Freeman’s argument that Mead had been misled by her Samoan interviewees has largely been discredited in the discipline.\nOther controversies of interpretation surround the particular characterizations of the three cultures profiled in Sex and Temperament, where they interlock with the personal lives of Mead and her collaborators Reo Fortune and Gregory Bateson, the former her husband at the time of that fieldwork and the latter her future spouse. David Lipset reviews Mead’s work and rival interpretations in “Rereading Margaret Mead’s Sepik Triptych and its Ethnographic Critics.”6 Lise M. Dobrin and Ira Bashkow’s “The Truth in Anthropology Does Not Travel First Class”7 exposes the four-way correspondence behind Mead’s break with Fortune while defending the latter’s read of local mythology.\nMead was active in the American Association of Anthropology, and its elected president in 1975. During the 1960s and 1970s, this pitted her in a generational struggle between older anthropologists like herself who had taken involvement in the US government’s overseas empire as a routine pre-requisite for their work, and a younger generation that was staunchly against the Vietnam War and developing a critique of anthropology’s implication in colonialism. (Mead and Bateson had both been involved with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II, with Bateson’s involvement considerably deeper and extending to covert service in South Asia. However, he would more publicly repudiate this course by the late 1960s.) Eric Wolf, then a rising star in the discipline, publicly confronted Mead at the 1971 AAA meeting over her ethics report downplaying American social scientists’ collaboration in the Vietnam war effort, which had been exposed by a student report.8\nMead’s overall legacy was the subject of a 1992 book and a 2003 conference at the Barnard Center for Research on Women. The speeches from the latter are collected as an issue of Scholar and Feminist Online.9 Leonora Foerstel and Angela Gilliam’s Confronting the Margaret Mead Legacy: Scholarship, Empire, and the South Pacific represents the primary example of post/anticolonial critique of Mead’s work. As Foerstel observes:\nThree of the authors are scholars at the University of Papua New Guinea. The co-editors also narrate the Mead-Wolf-Vietnam controversy in chapter 5.",

    "text": "Where is the Wikipedia community on AI?\nHeather Ford formally researched Wikipedia community concerns about generative AI and gave this talk presenting this paper in late 2025. Here’s her summary of community concerns:\n\nDoes the potential use of generative Al threaten knowledge integrity on Wikipedia? If so, how?\n\n\n\nReliability, trustworthiness, accuracy: proliferation of Al-generated misinformation, hallucinations and biased content because of the difficulty in fact-checking and verifying Al outputs.\nEquality: uneven distribution of risk because genAl tools are not available for all languages and because low editor numbers in smaller versions could tip the balance away from human control over curation, especially among non-English speakers.\nExploitation: the commercial exploitation of open content and editor labour by genAl companies. - Sustainability: the long-term sustainability of Wikipedia with the potential for people to turn increase in Al for their information needs.\nVerifiability: when the link between a claim and its source is broken, readers are no longer able the veracity of a claim or participate in the process of knowledge curation leading information pollution on Wikipedia and the degradation of the broader information environment, or even model collapse.\n\n\nIn the in-person Wikimedia community, I think that opinions continue to vary widely, with both a heavy interest in experimentation and a desire to protect the encyclopedia. (I’m basing this on WikiConference North America.) WMF continues to demo or profile its AI-powered improvement experiments, such as “semantic search” that would allow visitors to ask questions in the Wikipedia search bar. And a lightning talk promoted a “release the bots” perspective that describes generative tools as powerful tools.\nOn English Wikipedia, discussion of LLM edits had deadlocked a couple of years ago: This proposed policy was never approved, but kept as an essay. Still, the community seems to be gradually moving towards a consensus of specific limitations on adding unfiltered LLM content to the encyclopedia. These online discussions end up being lengthy and multi-sided, with one axis of contention pitting “defend the rules, whether AI or not” versus “limit (or even ban) mass LLM content.” This is complicated by the cross-cutting issue of smaller use cases for AI, where AI-inclusionists tend to use the prospect of forbidding AI grammar checks as a straw man, while AI exclusionists struggle to find a minimum set of off-limits use cases that can reach consensus. A series of hard limits in particular areas has, however, reached consensus: WP:LLM forbids the creation of new article with generative AI; new articles with clear AI artifacts may be speedily deleted; WP:AITALK limits the use of LLMs in formal talk page debates and allows for new topics to be closed if they weren’t opened by a human willing to articulate their ideas for themselves (but reopened once an initial user does so). A very long RFC is underway on a somewhat stronger LLM edit guideline, which seems likely to be modified once more before it’s approved.\n\n\nWP:NEWLLM Large language models (LLMs) can be useful tools, but they are not good at creating entirely new Wikipedia articles. Large language models should not be used to generate new Wikipedia articles from scratch.\nWP:AITALK LLM-generated comments: Comments, nominations, and opening statements that are obviously generated (not merely refined) by a large language model or similar AI technology may be struck or collapsed with {Collapse AI top}. In formal discussions, this may result in the speedy closure of irrelevant or disruptive discussions\nSpeedy Deletion Criterion G15. LLM-generated pages without human review [Delete without discussion] any [new] page that exhibits one or more of the following signs that … would have been removed by any reasonable human review: Communication intended for the user … Implausible non-existent references … Nonsensical citations.\nWikiProject AI Clean-Up and the essay at WP:LLM have become a central repositories for demonstrations of valuable LLM-assisted editing, the policy discussions on Wikipedia. One impressive recent demonstration appeared on Wikipedia Signpost: user Tilman Bayer prompted GPT-5 Thinking to find errors in every daily featured article and it suggested 56 errors over a month, 38 of which Bayer confirmed.",

    "text": "Spectral Traces: Unveiling Power through Engaged Research on Violence\nIn alignment with this year’s AAA theme of “Ghosts,” this panel explores how research on individual deaths and acts of violence intersects with exposing larger systems of power. By examining specific instances of state and political violence, we aim to illuminate the structural forces that perpetuate cycles of oppression, displacement, and human rights abuses across diverse contexts.\nOur panelists investigate how communities grapple with the aftermath of violence, from engagement with grassroots movements to state-sanctioned forensic investigations. We consider the ways in which death, loss, and sacrifice are imbued with social and political meaning, often becoming rallying points for resistance and transformation. The panel delves into the complex relationships between violence and care, exploring how sites of trauma can be reclaimed and repurposed by affected communities.\nCentral to our discussion is the role of memory and commemoration in confronting past atrocities. We examine how societies navigate the liminal spaces between remembering and forgetting, and how mapping and documenting violent events can serve as both a scientific endeavor and a form of social mobilization. The panel also addresses the challenges of seeking justice and remedy in the wake of displacement and state violence, considering both formal legal processes and grassroots initiatives.\nBy focusing on specific case studies from Latin America and the Caribbean, we aim to draw broader conclusions about the nature of political violence and its long-term impacts on individuals and communities. Our interdisciplinary approach combines anthropological, historical, and forensic methodologies to uncover the often invisible structures that underpin systems of oppression.\nKey themes include:\n\nThe mobilization of death and sacrifice in social movements\nTransformation of spaces associated with state violence\nThe intersection of science, law, and community action in human rights investigations\nMapping and memorialization as tools for confronting past atrocities\nThe social history and ongoing consequences of forced displacement\nGrassroots and state-led approaches to transitional justice\n\nThrough these diverse yet interconnected topics, we seek to contribute to ongoing debates about historical memory, accountability, and the enduring legacies of political violence. By examining the “ghostly” remnants of past conflicts and their contemporary manifestations, we hope to shed light on pathways toward healing, justice, and societal transformation.",

    "title": "Conflict deaths in Bolivia, 2023–24",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Eleven people have died in social movement-related violence in Bolivia since the beginning of 2023, ten of them the victims of violence carried out by other social groups. These conflicts pitted rural community members against miners, as well as disputes within the same profession, be it mining cooperatives, urban transit drivers, or rival claimants to rural land. Only one death, in January 2023, was caused by security forces, who fired a projectile into the eye of a bystander during raucous protests over the arrest of right-wing governor Luis Fernando Camacho.\nIn addition, the government of Luis Arce attributed four deaths from medical causes to the side effects of pro-Evo Morales blockades in January 2024. (Per our codebook, we record such collateral consequences but exclude them from other analysis.)\n\nDeadly protest events, January 2023–August 2024\nThe recent events are as follows:\nCamacho arrest protests: The December 28 arrest of Santa Cruz’s governor (and ex-presidential candidate) Luis Fernando Camacho touched off immediate protests in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the regional capital. Following a one-day airport takeover, members of Camacho’s Civic Movement alternated between daytime blockades and nighttime property destruction. On New Year’s Day, police fired a projectile—likely a tear-gas canister—into the eye of Edwin Chávez Durán. The man enduring no fewer than seven surgeries over the next two weeks before succumbing to a heart attack on January 13.\nMapiri mining clash: Amid negotiations upon the filing of mining permits for a mine site located on the Merque river, confrontations began between prospective miners at the site and community members. The mining firm, Minera La Deseada, is described as Chilean, and the workers involed as arriving outsiders, some or all from Caranavi, according to the OTB of Mapiri, led by Ruddy Salcedo. Salcedo describes a Chilean business owner as present at the start of the confrontation, urging them to begin work by force. Community members occupied the disputed site, waiting for police to arrive. In the ensuing confrontation, stones, dynamite, and firearms were used, wounding ten people and killing Jhilmer Cuele Sompero. Community struggles challenging the La Deseada Mine have been ongoing for years; a 2020 mobilization shows leaders describing a five year struggle up to that point. In 2020, they were demanding the enforcement of a ruling by the national mining authority AJAM.\nLimoncito mining conflict: On March 1, police accompanied an inspection visit by AJAM to document the stone-mining operation of the Dracruz company, in Limoncito, El Torno municipality. The delegation was confronted by mine workers who launched rockets and otherwise attacked the inspectors and police. Amid a retreat, Sub-Lieutenant Ronald Choque Mamani suffered a cardio-pulmonary arrest and collapsed to the ground. (Initial reports of bullet wounds to the officer proved unfounded.) He could not be revived. Five men were taken into custody for investigation by the FELCC and prosecutors [@AutopsiaConfirmaQue2023]. Subsequent inspection on March 10 revealed an unpermitted mining operation extending over 16 hectares of municipal land. Police then took both heavy equipment and documentation from the company . Local residents had complained of the operation, and have an ongoing campaign against other illegal mining operations.\nSantagro rural land dispute: In El Puente municipality of Santa Cruz, conflict flared up between members of the Intercultural farmer federation, who established settlements there in December 2023, and the employees of the Santagro soy producing company, which works on the land. The armed confrontation on March 30 claimed the lives of two men, Francisco Morales and Jorge Pérez.\nCotoca land dispute: During a confrontation between established residents and squatters in Cotoca, Herland Salinas Añez was stabbed multiple times, first by a machete and then by a short blade knife (arma blanca) and killed. Several others suffered machete and bullet wounds during the confrontation. Witness reports describe the confrontation as continuing over several days. Police arrested 25 to 33 people, whom they investigated for the illegal land occupation. Per a more detailed report, the housing takeover was sudden and carried out by a group arriving in a van, making the squatters the attackers.\nLaji Lurizani mining conflict: Wilmer Chambi Salcedo, 25, was shot and died while in an ambulance transporting him from Apolo to La Paz. He was one of four wounded in a conflict in the Santa Rosa community in the Laja sector of Apolo on September 13, 2023. The violence resulted from a conflict between illegal miners and community members in the protected Parque Nacional y Área Natural de Manejo Integrado Madidi (PN-ANMI Madidi). On September 15, the Autoridad Jurisdiccional Administrativa Minera (AJAM) reaffirmed that no mining rights were granted anywhere in the protected area. The same day, police arrived in the conflict zone and took control of the Laji Lurizani community. Bitza Delgado, the wife of the deceased Wilmer Chambi Salcedo, demanded that the authorities move to find those responsible for his death.\nThe death marked a continued worsening of violence due to mining conflicts in the Apolo region of northern La Paz. Illegal and informal mining thrives in the region. On September 18, community members of Laji Lurizani arrived in La Paz’s Plaza Murilo to protest the activities of illegal miners and their backers, and the absence of the state. Residents testified and presented photographic evidence of how illegal miners force them under threat of violence to allow them to do what they want in the area.\nPailitas land dispute: A week of armed confrontation between interculturales and peasants disputing land rights in the Forest Reserve of the Ascensión de Guarayos province resulted in the death of the intercultural Félix Ribera Bellido (23) of San Julían and the injury of 14 others. The death occurred early on the morning of December 2, when a conflict erupted between the communities of Pailitas and Santa María (in the Los Londras area). On December 6, the leader of the interculturales of San Julían, Tito Rokas, threatened the death of landowners in the province, claiming they were responsible for the violence. President Luis Arce announced that the violence would not be tolerated and summoned an emergency meeting of ministers to analyze the land conflict and propose structural solutions. The director of the National institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA) emphasized however that the lands being fought over were in fact property of the state, as all of the properties lie withing the Gurayos Forest Reserve. The Bolivian Ombudsman’s Office condemned the violence and called upon all actors to lower the temperature and to find peaceful solutions to the conflict. On January 16, 2024, Heber Sixto Canaza Sacaca (47), one of the leaders of the San Julían syndicate, was charged with homicide, for his role in inciting the violence on December 2, and for land trafficking, due to his promise to deliver properties in the municipality to intercultural groups. He was apprehended and taken into custody on January 15 and transferred to Santa Cruz by the FELCC. Sixto Canza had also been previously involved in another armed conflict in the Las Londras area in 2021, during which a group of journalists, police, and businessmen were kidnapped and tortured.\nCochabamba transit clash: A taxi driver suffered blunt force trauma while being attacked by drivers of a rival union of drivers disputing their line. One report indicates he and his brother were dragged out of their vehicle and held in another, possibly suffering the wound when jumping out of the vehicle. A doctor described blunt trauma inflicted by a large stone.\nGuanay mining clash: Conflict among miners resulted in two injuries (both with metal shrapnel) and the trauma-induced heart attack of Mauricio Soliz Miranda.\nYani mining conflict: National Police intervened in the Yani community of Sorata municipality where two groups of cooperative miners were in open confrontation. This confrontation included injuries from firearms suffered inside the mine the night of July 25. Sent to accompany officials from AJAM and to de-escalate the conflict, the police were confronted by members of one side of the dispute. Reportedly, the miners threw rocks and dynamite at the arriving police, and set the hill on fire. Caught in the flames, two police officers suffered severe burns to 70% and 80% of their bodies respectively. One of those burned, Fabricio Reynoso Gutiérrez, succumbed to his injuries in a La Paz hospital. Altogether, four police were hospitalized. Two alleged perpetrators were arrested and held in preventative detention. One party to the dispute was the Cooperativa Minera “Señor de Mayo”, seemingly the side complaining of illegal occupation of their stake, while the other side (per a social media post circulated by Señor de Mayo) is known as Hijos de Ingenio. The latter allege further violence by Hijos de Ingenio, including a shooting on the following day.\n\n\nThe pattern of violence under President Luis Arce has shifted from past conflict\nAs we near the end of Luis Arce’s fourth year as president, it’s now clear that political violence in Bolivia has taken a new shape. The left–right conflict, which claimed 38 lives during the 2019 political crisis (most of them shot dead during grassroots protests against the newly installed Áñez government), has receded in violence. Five deaths occurred from this longstanding divide.\n\n\n\nDeaths by presidency since 2001. Click to view this chart since 1982\n\n\nPublic protest in Bolivia remains active as ever, but there has been little deadly violence between police and people protesting the government. Only two people have been killed in sociopolitical conflicts by security forces, a jailed official who died after mistreatment and a protester wounded by a less-lethal munition. Only one presidency saw less lethal violence by Bolivian security forces since 1982: Eduardo Rodríguez’s eight-month interim government. Comparable restraint was shown under the leadership of Hernán Siles Zuazo (1982–85) and Carlos Mesa (2003–05).\nInstead, it is local and inter-movement conflicts that are taking the deadliest toll: 32 deaths in four years. Additionally, all three of the deaths of state security forces came in instances where the Arce government intervened to stop violence between conflicting communities of its own supporters, in conflicts over coca union leadership in Apolo, over mining in Sorata and El Torno.\nWith the exception of two university student government-related tragedies, in Potosí and El Alto, these are competitions over land, employment, and environment. These conflicts are the dark side of a literal gold rush in northwest Bolivia and a fundamentally similar rush for rural land and space for housing on the urban periphery. Asserting collective claims to land or mining rights is not new in Bolivia, but disputes among competing groups have become increasingly violent in a handful of regions, with mining collectives, agribusiness companies, and intercultural settlers increasingly turning to firearms in clashes to defend their claims. These groups are part of large economic strata, notably cooperative miners and intercultural peasants, who participate in the grassroots coalition behind Bolivia’s governing party, complicating the government’s management of such conflicts. Meanwhile the administrative agencies, AJAM for mining and INRA for land frequently find themselves asserting that one even both sides of these conflicts have a legal right to disputed territory.\n\n\n\nDeadly events during the Arce administration by protest domain and locale\n\n\nRelative restraint by the Arce government in the use of deadly force has been a welcome change from the massacres of the interim government. The remaining question is whether the Movement Towards Socialism can adjudicate disputes over land and calm local tensions within its grassroots base.\nClick here for an interactive directory of directory of all deaths recorded in the dataset.

Bender’s take is that hype is driving the AI discussion, and that there are substantive ethical problems with current models.

    "text": "Outspoken AI scientists:\n\nFei-Fei Li, Director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute, a crossover from AI science to humanities who invented the term “foundation models.”\nGeoffrey Hinton, researcher into neural-network-based machine learning. His experience with creating vision models whose internal workings are inscrutable have convinced him that knowing how AI works isn’t essential to believing that it works. For good insight on this view, and contrasts with Li, listen to Geoffrey Hinton in conversation with Fei-Fei Li\n\nA notable moment in the the Hinton–Li conversation comes at 1h18, where they are asked whether “we are at the point where we can say [LLMs/foundational models] have understanding and intelligence?” Hinton’s answer is at 1h30. Li responds at 1h35.\nAlso, the core of Hinton’s perspective may be this definition of education: “So the way we exchange knowledge, roughly speaking, this is something of a simplification, but I produce a sentence and you figure out what you have to change in your brain, so you might have said that, that is if you trust me.” “What I want to claim is that these millions of features and billions of interactions between features are understanding. … If you ask, how do we understand, this is the best model of how we understand.” (“Will digital intelligence replace biological intelligence?” Romanes Lecture at 14m28s )\n\nMelanie Mitchell (Wikipedia | Substack blog) — A very hands-on research expert on AI development and benchmarking who asks hard questions. She’s the author of\n\nMelanie Mitchell’s recent research has been examining the cognitive processes in LLM-based AI systems, including through experiments. In a recent talk, “Evaluating Cognitive Capacities in AI Systems” at the 2025 Natural Philosophy Symposium at Johns Hopkins, she lays out this work. Mitchell argues that increasing performance by AI systems seems grounded in multiplying numbers of heuristic associations rather than the “abstract reasoning” named by the labs creating current foundation models. She and collaborators have developed experiments to confirm this, in part by demonstrating that AI model performance declines when letters are swapped out from a simple sequence task (an experiment much like the well-publicized Apple paper on distractor information interfering with reasoning). She also offers one of the clearest explanations of the ARC abstract reasoning tests and talks about how her lab has been creating simpler versions of these tests to probe just how LLMs handle abstractions, when they can.\nOn the B-side, if you will, of Mitchell’s lecture video come comments from Alison Gopnik. Her focus is reframing AI not as a self-conscious (or eventually self-conscious) reasoning technology, but rather as a novel form of social aggregation, best thought of as a successor to the library or the market, or even to the state and regulation. She argues that it’s pointless to ask who is smarter: a scientist or a library. Indeed, this is a kind of “category error” that misses the more important point: what can one, or many scientists do with a library that they couldn’t do without one? When thought of as a social aggregator that lends power to new actions, we end up a lot closer to the notion of “Intelligence Augmentation,” a converse goal to Artificial Intelligence that’s explored in Possible Minds and in Machines of Loving Grace.)\n(For what it’s worth, I find the social aggregation metaphor to be a much clearer description of what the text tha pours out from AI chatbot firehose than the intelligent agent metaphor. It explains how fully formed units of code that appeared elsewhere sometimes show up, and how interpolated summary segments also show up. As Melanie Mitchell writes elsewhere, and I’m paraphrasing here, “like Soylent Green, AI is people.”)",

February interview on Hard Fork. November appearance on NYT DealBook (video). In essence, Amodei who has prophesied the near-term arrival of AGI continues to believe that scaling up LLMs is the way to get there.\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI: Instead of listening to Sam Altman, let me suggest reading one of the two up-close books on Altman and OpenAI’s rise published this year: Karen Hao’s Empire of AI6 which describes the AI industry as not just about its product, but about the acquisition of creative labor (through training data) and coordination of human labor and energy (through its overseas workforce and data centers) in ways that echo colonial enterprises. Keach Hagey’s The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future7 is more, well, optimistic. As a comparative review put it, Hagey “stands Altman as the secular prophet preaching human progress and boundless optimism.”\nThis interview quote from Karen Hao on Altman is informative, suggesting that his ability to shift narratives makes him something of an unreliable narrator on even his own views:\n\n“He’s a once-in-a-generation fundraising talent. That is his particular skill. And he’s also a once-in-a-generation storytelling talent, which is effectively why he’s so good at fundraising. He is able to paint these extremely persuasive visions of the future. He was already prominent within Silicon Valley, and Silicon Valley very much runs on stories and telling stories about the future. And one of the things that I sort of concluded through the reporting of my book is that when he says something to someone, what he’s saying is more tightly correlated with what he thinks they need to hear than what he actually believes or the ground truth of the thing. He’s able to say the things that really provoke people to kind of rally towards a general, broad, sweeping mission that he paints.8\n\n\n6 Karen Hao, Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI (Penguin Press, 2025).7 Keach Hagey, The optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the race to invent the future, First edition (W.W.

Many argue that cultivating a distant sci-fi future into existence is a supreme ethical goal, outweighing say the ecological survival of planet Earth or the near-term wellbeing of most humans.\nIf you want a readable summary of these ideas and their influence, More Everything Forever10 is your guided tour. Torres and comedian Kate Willett’s podcast Dystopia Now (Apple | Spotify) is a regular look at this world.\n10 Adam Becker, More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley’s Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity (Basic Books, 2025).",

Now, leaders are eager to channel this enthusiasm. Among the increased demands executives have placed on workers in the past year, requesting they use AI tools to increase their output tops the list (37%). Already 39% of companies require employees to use AI tools, with an additional 46% encouraging employees to use the tools without mandating that they do so.\n\n\nHowever, this new technology has not yet fully delivered on this productivity promise: Nearly half (47%) of employees using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect, and 77% say these tools have actually decreased their productivity and added to their workload.\n\n\nFor example, survey respondents reported that they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content (39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now being asked to do more work (21%).\n\nTechnology author Mayo Olshin: “If however, you simply”trust” the Al outputs due to lack of knowledge, skill, or willingness to review results, the long term damage will outweigh the initial productivity gains you got so “hyped” about.” A similar experience from David Chisnall on CoPilot: “It has cost me more time than it has saved.”",

    "text": "This week’s readings attempt to capture anthropological thinking at the moment when Enlightenment thought is seeding the formation of the modern research university. While it will take some further decades for “the science of man” to escape from Natural History and take its place alongside other social scientific disciplines in the Western Academy, essential foundation for all three of these elements in that story (anthropology, the research university, and the social sciences) were all being laid around 1800.\nThis larger story is the reason why we return to Eric Wolf’s “Introduction” to Europe and the People Without History1 this week. Wolf’s book attempts a six-century account of global processes in which both colonizing and colonized societies were radically transformed and his introduction make the theoretical case that the often-presumed object of anthropological study, distinct “traditional societies,” each with their own “culture,” is an illusion.\n1 Eric R. Wolf, Introduction (Univ. of California Press, 1982).\nBy turning names into things we create false models of reality. By endowing nations, societies, or cultures with the qualities of internally homogeneous and externally distinctive and bounded objects, we create a model of the world as a global pool hall in which the entities spin off each other like so many hard and round billiard balls. Thus it becomes easy to sort the world into differently colored balls… (6)\n\nRelevantly for this week, Wolf describes “The Rise of the Social Sciences” in an argument which is more of an intellectual lament than a chronological account. For Wolf, sociology, political science, and economics are incomplete disciplines, which artificially sever certain relationships from the broader whole, most crucially by failing to take an integrated look at political economy. He notes that sociology was initially a political project aimed at fostering social cohesion (on this point, see more directly Mostajir2), and that political science and economics have been oriented around formal models of their spheres of interest that leave out that which is crucial.\n2 Parysa Mostajir, Social Physics, Industrialization, and the French Revolution, n.d., https://voices.uchicago.edu/pmostajir/2020/10/19/history-of-social-science-lecture-4-social-science-industrialization-and-the-french-revolution/.3 Immanuel Kant, “Beantwortung Der Frage: Was Ist Aufklärung?” Berlinische Monatsschrift, December 1784.4 Immanuel Kant, Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, 1799.5 Michel Foucault, What Is Enlightenment?, n.d., https://foucault.info/documents/foucault.whatIsEnlightenment.en/.All of this separation and stratification has taken place in the context of the modern research university, that entity that emerged in the 19th century as states worked to formalize the space of intellectual inquiry demanded by Enlightenment thinkers. In the readings these are represented by Immanuel Kant’s essay, “What is Enlightenment?”34 and the commentary on it by Michel Foucault.5 Without denying that the state is due the obedience of the public, Kant urges the right to freedom of argument.\nThe devastating invasions by Republican and Napoleonic France taught a stinging lesson to the still-divided German-speaking realms, and “counter-Enlightenment” reforms of society included the creation of new academic, military, and state institutions. Germany’s Humboldtian universities set out the basic contours of modern academic life: tenure, freedom of thought for professors, unity of research and teaching, and isolation from non-scholarly life.6\n6 R. D. Anderson, European Universities from the Enlightenment to 1914 (Oxford University Press, 2004), https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.001.0001.\n\n\nGeorges Cuvier (1769-1832) and works from La Regne Animal\n\n\nIn France, Enlightenment influence would be sanctified. Voltaire and Rousseau were literally exhumed and reburied at the Panthéon7 and a variety of symbolic and institutional rebirths remade the French state. In that context, both revolutionary and post-Revolutionary Napoleonic governments sought to remake the academy, along with the rest of society.\n7 Talj Gordon Tatum, Panthéonizations and Exhumations : Ceremonial Reburials in Revolutionary France., 2016, https://hdl.handle.net/2104/9800.\n\n\n\nThe Panthéon of Paris in 1795; image by Jean Baptiste Hilaire\n\n\n\nFrench natural history, with Georges Cuvier as a leading scholar, focused on systematizing knowledge of past and present lifeforms and he turned its categorizing gaze upon humans as well, proposing a three-part, hierarchical racial schema (Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian) with multipe sub-branches. George Stocking lays out the broader directions of early anthropological research in France.\nPermalink: https://carwilb.github.io/teaching/history-anthro-w3.html",

    "title": "Ninetenth-Century Evolutionary Anthropology",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“Anthropology, as it was practiced throughout much of the 19th century,” writes Rachel Caspari, “was a single biocultural discipline, with race linking the components.”1 Even though the nineteenth century saw a tremendous intellectual revolution in human biology—the introduction of a formal understanding of evolution—the foundational role of race remained unshaken, even reinforced, by this change.\n1 Rachel Caspari, “From Types to Populations: A Century of Race, Physical Anthropology, and the American Anthropological Association,” American Anthropologist 105, no. 1 (2003): 65–76.This week’s readings center three forms of evolutionary thinking in nineteenth century anthropology, which were tied together in the minds of their advocates: cultural evolution through stages of savagery, barbarism, and civilization; biological evolution of species (and it was presumed, races); and “social Darwinism” to describe the relative success of nations and classes.\nStefanos Gerlounas describes the nineteenth century as a time of three-stage theories of human pre/history, embraced across the century by Comte, Spencer, Tylor, Morgan, Marx, Engels, and Frazer. Lewis Henry Morgan’s Ancient Society2 and Edward Burnett Tylor’s Primitive Culture3 both make the same intellectual move, situating contemporary “savage” cultures as living fossils of a prior “primitive” era in human history, through which “barbarian” and “civilized’ peoples had already passed:\n2 Lewis H Morgan, Ancient Society, or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization (Charles H Kerr; Company, 1877), http://archive.org/details/ancientsociety035004mbp.3 Edward Burnett Tylor, Primitive culture: Researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom (Murray, 1920), http://archive.org/details/primitiveculture01tylouoft.\nThe thesis which I venture to sustain, within limits, is simply this, that the savage state in some measure represents an early condition of mankind, out of which the! higher culture has gradually been developed or evolved, by processes still in regular operation as of old, the result showing that, on the whole, progress has far prevailed over! relapse. (Tylor, p. 32)\nThe remote ancestors of the Aryan nations presumptively passed through an experience similar to that of existing barbarous and savage tribes. Though the experience of these nations embodies all the information necessary to illustrate the periods of civilization, both ancient and modern. (Morgan)\n\nEnglish professor Patrick Brantlinger is concerned with the rhetoric of extinction attached to Indigenous peoples worldwide by European writers, scientific and otherwise. These discourses were both certain of the impending extinction of savage peoples, and if trouble by it, only troubled from a scientific point of view. Brantlinger argues that these views were generally dismissive:\n\nWith a few exceptions—Lewis Henry Morgan and Alfred Russel Wallace are perhaps the main ones—most evolutionists treat primitive races and cultures negatively, not only as doomed by the inexorable laws of nature but also as meriting their pending extinctions. (165)\n\nDark Vanishings incorporates a wide range of nineteenth century anthropologists including: Thomas Jefferson (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1787); Albert Gallatin (Synopsis of the Indian Tribes of North America, 1836; founder of the American Ethnological Society, 1842) Henry Schoolcraft (The American Indians, Their History, Condition and Prospects); Samuel Morton (Crania Americana, 1839); Lewis Henry Morgan (League of the Iroquois, 1854); Josiah Nott and George Glidden (Types of Mankind, 1854),\nWe find in Brantlinger a surprising combination of salvage ethnography and celebration of savage demise. While making the case for “keep[ing] some scientific record of that which we destroy”, Pitt-Rivers sees no place for actual native peoples in the future other than in chains: “the savage is morally and mentally an unfit instrument for the spread of civilization, except when, like the higher mammal, he is reduced to slavery; his occupation is gone, and his place is required for an improved race.”\n\nFor broader views of American anthropology during this period, consider the earliest chapter in Lee Baker’s From Savage to Negro;4 Glynn Custred in A History of Anthropology As a Holistic Science;5 and many segments of David Hurst Thomas’ Skull Wars.6\n4 Lee D Baker, From Savage to Negro: Anthropology and the Construction of Race, 1896-1954 (University of California Press, 1998).5 Glynn Custred, Anthropology in the Nineteenth Century (Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2017).6 David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity (Basic Books, 2002).\n\n\n\nMutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution in its 2021 “Illuminated” edition\n\n\n7 Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man (Archives at NCBS, 1901), http://archive.org/details/ncbs.BB-001_0_0_0_1.\nDarwin, whose 1859 On the Origin of Species laid out the overall case for biological evolution, delayed direct consideration of the relationship of human to other animals for The Descent of Man, published in 1871.7 While Darwin presumes significant differences among “the races of man” and devotes a chapter to the topic, the text presumes a common human ancestor to all these racial groups and argues forcefully for the species’ overall closeness with primates in particular and animals in general. Nonetheless, racial groups and racial stereotypes are part of the evidentiary landscape used throughout.\nDarwin gives priority to organisms’ struggle for survival under conditions of scarcity (the primary form of natural selection in Origin), and secondary consideration to differential rates of reproduction as determined by competition for mates (theorized in Descent). Less considered by Darwin are competitions among groups and species themselves, which would more readily include tendencies towards communication, cooperation, and (a certain form of) altruism.\nThe first, more competitive form of natural selection became the basis for so-called social Darwinism, framed as “survival of the fittest” and associated with sociologist Herbert Spencer as well as founding eugenicist Francis Galton.\nA radically distinct view of natural behavior is presented by Pyotr (“Peter”) Kropotkin in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. Kropotkin highlights a wide variety of examples of cooperative behavior among animals (and plants), as well as human at each level of the social evolutionary ladder. While the subject of much skepticism initially, Kropotkin’s overall ideas overlap with Darwin’s, and mutualism within species is taken seriously as a factor in interspecies competition and macroevolution by current biologists.\nStephen Jay Gould (2000:471) even argues that Kropotkin and Darwin’s different emphases stem from their research environments: “In fact, Kropotkin, who was well trained in biology, spoke for a Russian consensus in arguing that density-independent regulation by occasional, but severe, environmental stress will tend to encourage intraspecific cooperation as a mode of natural selection. The harsh environments of the vast Russian steppes and tundras often elicited such a generalized belief; Kropotkin and colleagues had observed well in a local context, but had erred in over generalization. But Darwin and Wallace, schooled in the … tropics, may have made an equally parochial error in advocating such a dominant role for biotic struggle over limited resources in crowded space.”8\n8 Stephen Jay Gould, The structure of evolutionary theory (Belknap Press, 2002).9 Gould, The structure of evolutionary theory.10 Michael Tomasello, Why We Cooperate, A Boston Review Book (The MIT Press, 2009), https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=88bf887e-e045-30b0-a60f-4a9cca13578a.11 David Sloan Wilson, Does Altruism Exist? : Culture, Genes, and the Welfare of Others, Foundational Questions in Science (Yale University Press, 2014), https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ff9db0f7-14f2-3c57-bb76-19f6ba1dcd7f.For recent summaries of species-level cooperation and mutualism, see paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould’s chapter on “Species as Individuals in the Hierachical Theory of Selection”;9 primatologist Michael Tomasello’s Why We Cooperate;10 and David Sloan Wilson’s Does Altruism Exist?.11\nPermalink: https://carwilb.github.io/teaching/history-anthro-w4.html",

    "text": "Historical context of the Ghost Dance\nThe colonization of the Great Plains through the Indian Wars is the context for the spread of the Ghost Dance religion. The Fort Laramie Treaties had recognized native sovereignty over the Great Plains in 1851, but volunteer and Federal Army troops began a new round of Indian Wars in the 1860s. Genocidal massacres, military internment, and the undermining of the Indian food supply followed in the succeeding decades. Killing buffalo as a tactic of counterinsurgency was pursued with abandon, as praised by General Philip Sheridan in 1875:\n\nThese men [the buffalo hunters] have done … more to settle the vexed Indian question than the entire regular army has done in the last 30 years. They are destroying the Indians’ commissary. … Send them powder and lead if you will, but for the sake of lasting peace let them kill, skin, and sell until the buffalo are exterminated.1\n1 Quoted in Winona LaDuke, All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life (South End Press, 1999), 141.\nThese measures constituted successive attacks on the physical and cultural mechanisms of survival of the Indians. And consciously so, as can be seen from the opinion of General William Tecumseh Sherman as early as 1867, “We must act with vindictive earnestness against the [Lakota], even to their extermination, men, women and children.”.2 The impact was devastating, as Dee Brown describes for the summer of 1874,\n2 Ward Churchill, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas, 1492 to the Present (City Lights, 1997), 240.\nIf such a season [of drought] had come upon this land a few years earlier, a thunder of a million buffalo hooves would have shaken the prairie in frantic stampedes for water. But now the herds were gone, replaced by an endless desolation of bones and skulls and rotting hooves. … Bands of Comanches, Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arapahos roamed restlessly, finding a few small herds, but many had to return to their reservations to keep from starving.3\n3 Dee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West, Thirtieth Anniversary ed. (H. Holt, 2001), 268.\nThose who chose the path of a negotiated surrender to reservations, as did those led by Sitting Bull in 1881, saw agreements for rations and safety undermined. Just two years after that agreement, Sitting Bull—noting “our rations have been reduced to almost nothing” and “many of our people have starved to death”—made a plea for material equality as a corollary of negotiation:\n\nYou white men advise us to follow your ways, and therefore I talk as I do. When you have a piece of land, and anyone trespasses on it, you catch them, and keep them until you get damages, and I am doing the same thing now…. I see my people starving, and I want the Great Father to make an increase in the amount of food that is allowed us now, so that they may be able to live. We want cattle to butcher—I want to kill 300 head of cattle at a time. That is the way you live and we want to live the same way.4\n4 LaDuke, All Our Relations, 97.\nNotwithstanding their pleas, more than one-third of the Lakota would die of starvation and disease between 1877 and 1890.5 The self-sufficiency of the Indians of the Great Plains was undermined on the terrain of physical survival, through the imposition of facts on the ground.\n5 LaDuke, All Our Relations, 97.Here is my recorded lecture segment on the historical context of the Ghost Dance:\n{{&lt;video https://youtu.be/dCuBskJzLo4 &gt;}}\nAnthropologist Ella Deloria featured an eyewitness account of the Ghost Dance from an elder who a child during the peak of the religion.\n  \nPermalink: https://carwilb.github.io/teaching/history-anthro-w5.html",

Manually define the Wikipedia redirect syntax with Hex Encoding\n  # # = %23 | [ = %5B | ] = %5D | Space = %20\n  prefix  &lt;- \"%23REDIRECT%20%5B%5B\"\n  suffix  &lt;- \"%5D%5D\"\n  \n  # 2.

    "title": "When did anthropology begin in the Western Hemisphere?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The second week’s readings tries to capture the “dawn” of anthropology in the Western Hemisphere (or perhaps the world engaged by European colonialism). It works not so much by seeking out the first sources chronologically as by capturing the range of different possible voices describing human and cultural others.1\n1 Carwil Bjork-James, Indigenous March in Defense of Isiboro Sécure Arrives in La Paz, Challenges Evo Morales Government (Background Briefing), October 16, 2011.\n\n\n\nCover of Las Casas’ A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (Seville, 1552)\n\n\n2 Bartolomé de las Casas, Bartolomé de las Casas and the defense of Amerindian rights: a brief history with documents, Atlantic crossings (The University of Alabama Press, 2020).3 Holger Henke and Fred Reńo, Modern Political Culture in the Caribbean (University of the West Indies Press, 2003).\nChronologically, the readings begin with the 16th century Spanish friar and missionary Bartolomé de las Casas (1484-1566), who wrote about the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and Central America.2 Las Casas is often credited as one of the first advocates for indigenous rights in the Americas, and his writings provide a critical perspective on the brutal treatment of native populations by European colonizers. Lewis Hanke3 profiles Las Casas as an anthropologist, specifically focusing on “his approach to the study of cultures so alien to his own” who used “the vast amount of material he had patiently gathered on various aspects of Indian life” to “understand the importance of their customs and beliefs within the framework of their own culture.”\nChristian Feest profiles4 early European reactions to Aztec and Mesoamerican art brought to Europe in 1521, the moment when the Spanish invasion of the Aztec empire was still ongoing. Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) is one of the first Europeans to react to Mesoamerican art, and he did so highly positively noting, “And yet I have all days of my life seen nothing that has thus delighted my heart as these things. For I have seen among them wonderful artificial things and have wondered at the subtle ingenia of the people in foreign lands.”\n4 Christian F. Feest, A First European Assessment of Indigenous American Art, 1992.5 Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca, A Brief Description of All the Western Indies, ed. Kris Lane, Neil L. Whitehead, Jo Ellen Fair, and Leigh A. Payne (Duke University Press, 2008), 165–212, https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780822389064-010/html.Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca5 (1557-1622) took a different view, situating his descriptive work on “the Western Indies” (the Americas, but largely South America) alongside a manual of advice for Spanish soldiers and colonizers and a polemical defense of the conquest against critics like Las Casas.\nIn American Pentimiento,6 Patricia Seed reflects on Iberian and English descriptions of indigenous peoples in the Americas. She argues that these texts should be read not as straightforward ethnographic accounts but also texts shaped around the need to provide religious and moral justifications for the appropriation of indigenous lands and labor. The optional chapter, “Sustaining Political Identities” summarizes the overall argument of her book, while “Cannibals” details this storytelling in Spanish America.\n6 Patricia Seed, American Pentimento: The Invention of Indians and the Pursuit of Riches (University of Minnesota Press, 2001).7 Roger Williams, A key into the language of America (Bedford, MA : Applewood Books, 1997), http://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wOfpAPRxlVYC.8 Sarah Vowell, The Wordy Shipmates (Penguin, 2009).9 Ana González, Roger Williams and the Pequot War, n.d., https://explore.thepublicsradio.org/stories/roger-williams-and-the-pequot-war/.In the English colonization of North America (note that colonization precedes the 1706-07 union forming Great Britain), Roger Williams, the Puritan founder of Rhode Island, is among the first to publish an ethnographic text, A Key into the Language of America (1643).7 The excerpt from Sarah Vowell’s The Wordy Shipmates8 narrates this multivocal text as well as the Pequot War that preceded its publication. This podcast9 focuses on Roger Williams’ direct participation in the Pequot War.\n\n\n\nContemporary woodcut illustration of the Mystic massacre\n\n\nFinally, the first three chapters of Amitav Ghosh’s The Nutmeg’s Curse10 situate the contemporaneous events of the Pequot war and the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands in 1621-22. Ghosh’s up-close look at early colonial violence speaks to the decisions behind colonial violence as well as the interrelations among different colonial projects and the internal religious wars of Europe. The chapter that follows argues that the colonization of indigenous lands is also interrelated with the de-sacralization of nature in Europe through the scientific revolution.\n10 Amitav Ghosh, The nutmeg’s curse: Parables for a planet in crisis (University of Chicago Press, 2021).Permalink: https://carwilb.github.io/teaching/history-anthro-w2.html",

    "title": "Conflict deaths in Bolivia, 2022",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Violent death cast a shadow over multiple social movements in Bolivia during the third calendar year of President Luis Arce. Deliberate killings came in clashes over land, mining, and the planned census, claiming eight lives, while tear gas detonated in a student meeting led to a stampede in which five were killed. A government bureaucrat who exposed a major corruption scandal died of years of mistreatment in prison. A motorcyclist was killed by a wire strung as part of a road blockade. And a brutal stabbing killed another participant in road blockades. Altogether, fifteen Bolivians lost their lives in or around Bolivia’s often charged movement conflicts.\nThe deadly events were as follows:\n\nLa Estrella land clash, March 19: Intercultural farmers had moved on March 12 to occupy lands on the “La Estrella” ranch, owned by Jacob Ostreicher and subject to claims of money laundering in a 2011 case that attracted international attention. These land occupiers were attacked on March 19 by armed people, either farmworkers or hired attackers presumibly sponsored by in-country landowner Claudia Liliana Rodríguez. (Ostreicher remains in exile.) The attackers confronted the Intercultural squatters around 22:00, shooting rockets and firing firearms. Franklin Delgadillo, son of Intercultural leader Ricardo Delgadillo, was shot and killed. The Interculturales maintained a multiday blockade demanding justice afterwards. Police arrested at least nine people for the killing in March 2022.\nDeath of imprisoned Indigenous Fund official, April 19: Marco Antonio Aramayo, the former director of Bolivia’s Fondo Indígena, died in custody following seven years of detention under an abusive avalanche of investigations in a scandal he himself brought to light. The Fondo Indígena, which Aramayo headed from 2013 to 2015, was intended to provide independent funding to indigenous communities for development and self-representation. Aramayo denounced in 2016 that the Fund was instead used by Minister Nemesia Achacolla as a slush fund during an election year.\nWhile many have been accused of corrupt acts, Aramayo has borne the highest weight of prosecutions (over 250 investigations begun); he was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in 2017. ITEI, a Bolivian organization that supports victims of torture and state violence, issued a statement: Aramayo’s “death is the tragic conclusion of a series of violations of [his] fundamental rights,” “which affect [him] and also affect people deprived of liberty in general.” According to the ITEI, which has provided medical and psychological attention to him since 2017, police and penal authorities tortured Aramayo physically with beatings and stress positions; biologically by depriving him of food, water, or medicine; psychologically with threats, extortion, insults, and humiliation. Aramayo was repeatedly required to travel to attend new cases across the country, with the final one filed two weeks before his death. Exhausted from his ordeal, Aramayo died of multiple organ failure, aggravated by diabetes and hypertension. While police announced an investigation into his death, his legal representative denounced that no actions had been taken three weeks later.\nPotosí university stampede, May 9: A nightmarish stampede ensued at Potosí’s Tomás Frías University after a tear gas grenade was set off during an indoor meeting to convene university federation elections. Some five thousand students were reportedly in the coliseum. Many were injured in the rush to flee, including four who were killed that day and one more who died on June 15. Reportedly two of the dead were mothers who leave behind children. Six were sent to intensive care. Between 71 and 83 were wounded. The tragedy was apparently amplified by the locking of the main exit doors.\nBolivian student politics operates in close coordination with national political parities and is often highly contentious. The tragedy also put attention on student leaders who maintain student status over decades and accumulate patronage and power in on-campus political organization.Four students, at least two of them involved in student politics, have been arrested in connection with the gas release and its deadly consequences. The Minister of Justice names Manfred Flores Canaza as the “principal and material author” of the crime.\nTinguipaya clash, May 15: Two men died in fratricidal violence in the town of Tinguipaya, Potosí. The brawl between differently organized Indigenous people—ayllus vs. campesinos—followed a visit by Vice President Choquehuanca and involved stones, sticks, slingshots, and rockets. Ironically, Choquehuanca’s speech, marking the opening of a political training school, had called for cross-cultural unity and fearless speech. The cause of the conflict remains totally disputed: national MAS-IPSP official attributed it to a local land conflict, while some local figures and opposition politicians blamed internal partisan disputes within the MAS-IPSP linked to the local mayor. Police attempting to investigate the incident had difficulty entering the area in the following days.\nChiñijo land clash, June 23: On June 23 a confrontation over land ownership in the community of Tamiplaya Tolapampa in Chiñijo, Sorata resulted in the beating deaths of two local campesinos and injury to an additional five. A group of 60 land-grabbers, hired and led by Gabriel Callisaya Toledo, Mario Luque, and Genaro Quito attacked the community in attempt to take their land, intimidating them with dynamite, dogs, and firearms. The General Secretary of Chiñijo, Susana Silva, claimed that Sorata police refused to provide assistance or to remove the bodies of the victims and only arrived at the on the 26th. Communities members protested by taking the victims’ bodies to Sorata in a protest march in order to demand justice. The community members possessed a resolution from the National Institue of Agrarian Reform (INRA) that recognized their right to the property and instructed the police to forcefully evict unlawful occupants.\nMapiri mining cooperatives clash, June 24: A group of expelled members of the Hijos de Pueblo gold mining cooperative attacked the cooperative in the community of Charobamba, Mapiri, in an attempt to regain leadership. A local teacher, Faustino Nestor Maqui Chambi, was killed when he was hit in the head by a stone, causing him to fall from his boat and drown. Police arrested 7 or 8 of the agressors, but their convoy was attacked in Aguada while transporting the arrested persons to La Paz and one the arrestees escaped.\nSanta Cruz census strike, deaths on October 22, November 9 and 10: The Santa Cruz Civic Movement mounted a 36-day department-wide strike in protest of the delay of the Census to 2024, and demanding it be held in 2023. Clash between supporters of Santa Cruz general strike and those attempting to open blockades. During an October 22 clash on the Amistad bridge that connects Santa Cruz with Brazil, a municipal employee of Arroyo Concepción, Julio Pablo Taborga, suffered injuries from blows to his head. He was transported to a hospital in Puerto Quijarro where his death was recorded early the next morning. According to Taborga’s wife, he was demonstrating against the blockade when supporters of the strike arrived with dynamite and homemade bombs and began to beat him. Video of the confrontation appeared to show victim succumbing to tear gas rather than a beating. The Santa Cruz Civic Committee released a statement blaming the MAS for the conflict.\nEduardo Arancibia Barrancos was killed in the early morning of November 9 while driving a motorcycle to work. He attempted to drive through a blockade point in the Tres Lagunas neigborhood of Santa Cruz. He did not notice that a coaxial cable was stretched across the road between two poles. This cable cut through his upper neck as he drove, causing his death. Police arested five men who were maintaining the blockade point.\nOvernight on November 11, a group of four or five people attacked two men who were maintaining a blockade in the Barrio Latino of the Los Lotes zone of Santa Cruz. The attackers assaulted Jairo Montero, 21, and José Eduardo Sosa, 28, with knives, leaving Montero hospitalized with criticall injuries and Eduardo Sosa dead. The Sosa’s heart was reportedly cut out of his chest by the attackers. Two of the attackers were arrested on November 15.\n\n\n\n\nTable of deaths in 2023\n\n\n\nTrends in protest deaths\nThe death in custody of Marco Antonio Aramayo marks the first social-movement-related death at the hands of the state under the presidency of Luis Arce. Otherwise, responsibility for these deaths rests among civilians and generally within social movements themselves, though the motives of the assault on José Eduardo Sosa need to be clarified. While international attention tends to focus on left-right partisan conflict in Bolivia, local conflicts over rural land (three to five deaths), mining (one death in Mapiri), or political affiliation made up the bulk of deaths in 2022.\nDeadly state violence against protesters, the modal situation in four decades of recorded death in the database, remains at a standstill. No security forces have killed a Bolivian protester since the Senkata massacre on November 19, 2019, and MAS-IPSP governments last saw a state-perpetrated killing in August 2018. Over the last four decades, state-perpetrated violence occurred more than six times as often under right wing governments as under left-wing ones (13.0 vs 2.1 deaths per year). Conversely, violence among civilians is 38% more frequent during left governments (5.64 vs 4.08 deaths per year).\nAs can be seen in the list above, investigation of the prepetrators of political violence was uneven, with the Tinguipaya clashes and the Aramayo death in custody possibly becoming the latest examples of impunity for violence. The extraordinary systemic delays in the Bolivian justice system make it likely that accountability for political violence in 2022 could take years to come through the judicial system.",

    "title": "Landmarks in conceptualizing the ethnographic field by Malinowski and Gluckman",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The two ethnographic works we’re reading this week are Bronislaw Malinowski’s Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922) and Max Gluckman’s article “Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand” (widely known as “The Bridge,” 1940). The two works make foundational methodological claims for how to do ethnography, but their foci are sharply different. Malinowski’s Argonauts would become a canonical text for fieldwork through participant observation, while Gluckman’s article is a landmark in the development of power-aware situational analysis.\n\nMalinowski’s Argonauts of the Western Pacific\n\n\n\nA photo (Plate I) from Malinowski’s Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922), showing the native village as well as Malinowski’s tent\n\n\nBronisław Malinowski (), a native of Krakow, received his doctorate there, only turning his attention to anthropology at that time, inspired by James Frazer’s The Golden Bough. He worked at the London School of Ecoonomics from 1910 and late in his life at Yale University.\nIt’s difficult to underestimate either the influence of Malinowski on the traditions of anthropological fieldwork or the broad impact of his students on mid-century social anthropology, which parallels that of Boas’ students in the United States. Among his students were E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Raymond Firth, Meyer Fortes, and Edmund Leach, each noted for their contributions to mid-century anthropological theory. Jomo Kenyatta studied social anthropology with Malinowski and crafted his essays on his Kikuyu people into the book Facing Mount Kenya (1938),1 which also stands as an indictment of British colonial misunderstandings of Kenyan society. Kenyatta returned to his native land in 1947, led the Kenyan African Union, and became the first president of Kenya until his death in 1978.\n1 Jomo Kenyatta, Facing Mount Kenya: the tribal life of the Gikuyu (Secker; Warburg, 1953), https://archive.org/details/facingmountkenya0000jomo_k4y6/page/n9/mode/2up.2 Vine. Deloria, Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto (Macmillan Company, 1969), 78–100.It’s remarkable how Malinowski’s argument for theoretically informed fieldwork in Argonauts is mirrored by Vine Deloria’s polemic2 against anthropologists in Native American communities who are concerned with theoretical questions rather than the practical problems of their research subjects.\nIn Argonauts, Malinowski also outlines a three-part vision for anthropological writing and data collection: (1) systematic data on a tribe’s organization and cultural forms; (2) elegant writing on “the imponderabilia of actual life” and behavior as recorded in ethnographic diaries; and (3) a corpus of native-language statements, myths, magical formula, and narratives. These lines of evidence converge in Malinowski’s widely cited statement of purpose for ethnography:\n\nThese three lines of approach lead to the final goal, of which an Ethnographer should never lose sight. This goal is, briefly, to grasp the native’s point of view, his relation to life, to realise his vision of his world. We have to study man, and we must study what concerns him most intimately, that is, the hold which life has on him. In each culture, the values are slightly different; people aspire after substance of their happiness—is, in my opinion, to miss the greatest reward different aims, follow different impulses, yearn after a different form of happiness. In each culture, we find different institutions in which man pursues his life-interest, different customs by which he satisfies his aspirations, different codes of law and morality which reward his virtues or punish his defections. To study the institutions, customs, and codes or to study the behaviour and mentality without the subjective desire of feeling by what these people live, of realising the which we can hope to obtain from the study of man.\n\n\n\nGluckman’s “Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand”\n\nMax Gluckman () was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1911. Gluckman studied anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg under Winifred Hoernlé and I. Schapera. He would later describe this training as part of the “sociological stream” of anthropology, which he traced upstream to those scholar’s teacher, Alfred “A.R.” Radcliffe-Brown, and through him to Emile Durkheim.3 His doctoral work in anthropology at Oxford brought him into direct contact with Radcliffe-Brown as well as E. E. Evans-Pritchard and solidified his attachment to social anthropology as his intellectual home.\n3 Max Gluckman, Order and Rebellion in Tribal Societies (Cohen & West, 1963), 2.4 Gluckman Max, The Kingdom of the Zulu of South Africa, 1st ed. (Routledge, 1987), 25–55, https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315683461-2.Gluckman traces his own intellectual biography in detail in an introductory essay to Order and Rebellion in Tribal Africa. After completing his doctorate, Gluckman returned to South Africa to conduct fieldwork among the Zulu people of Natal. His article written in the field, “The Kingdom of the Zulu in South Africa” considers 120 years of Zulu history from the nation’s founding by Shaka Zulu in 1818-24. The focus is within the Zulu Nation, but is on turbulent processes of political change through rebellions that nonetheless maintain the nation and its monarchy. Gluckman considers the Zulu people’s relationships to the British colonial power as part of this history.4\nHowever, his article “Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand” (1940),5 commonly referred to as “The Bridge,” casts the largest shadow on broader anthropology, precisely because it re-conceptualizes the colonial society in South Africa as a single biracial society and because it introduced an approach to situational analysis that tacks betweeen specific events and the broader social structure. In effect, Gluckman imports the concept of segmentary society, previously applied to complex African polities to the colonial situation of racially stratified power in South Africa.\n5 Max Gluckman, Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand (Published on behalf of the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute by the Manchester University Press, 1958).Gluckman’s approach shifts the framing of anthropology from “the Native” society to the social world that includes the anthropologist him or herself, the colonial government, missionaries, employers, and the entire complex power structure. At root is consideration of what we now call “his own subject position” and a kind of narration later termed “reflexivity.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“White men in front – prepared to leave for Nongoma,” 2012 painting by Linda Bjørnskov from her solo exhibition “The Whispering of Max Gluckman’s Bridge Paper”\n\n\n\nObviously many difficulties beset an anthropologist in this situation, especially if he comes to study race-relationships themselves. He cannot walk around asking about these and his presence always disturbs the people. I did not drop as an isolated individual into Zulu life, recording with superior impartiality what I observed. I came as a White – and the Zulu had to fit me in as an eccentric and highly suspect member of the dominant White group. As a White, I was a “chief” and that created about me latent political power. I early became conscious of attempts by the Zulu to use me for their own advantage and to play me against both Black and White personalities. … My later data on general White-Zulu relationships shows that what happened to me was not the unique result of my character and views, though it was affected by these, but crystallized the form of Zululand social structure itself. — Max Gluckman, “Conflict and Cohesion in Zululand: An Historical Study in Social Organization,” unpublished manuscript written c. 1946.6\n6 Robert J. Gordon and H. Max Gluckman, “On Burning One’s Bridge: The Context of Gluckman’s Zulu Fieldwork: With the Previously Unpublished Chapter “the Research Situation” (Circa 1946),” History in Africa 41 (2014): 183, https://www.jstor.org/stable/26362088.\nSome amazing context for Max Gluckman’s “The Bridge” article is offered in Robert Gordon’s “On Burning One’s Bridge: The Context of Gluckman’s Zulu Fieldwork,”7 to which is appended Gluckman’s unpublished note that is quoted above. Here is its suggestive abstract:\n7 Gordon and Gluckman, “On Burning One’s Bridge.”\nAbstract: Gluckman’s 1940 essay “An Analysis of a Social Situation in Modern Zululand” (aka as “The Bridge”) is widely acknowledged as one of the most influ- ential in social anthropology for signalling a paradigm shift. This paper publishes a chapter of a previously unpublished, undated manuscript by Gluckman – probably from 1946 – describing how he did fieldwork in Zululand. A contextualizing essay discusses why Gluckman went to Zululand, what his preparations were, how he famously got “banned,” the role of the regent and the native commissioners in orchestrating this, and how local anti-semitism also played its part. It also suggests that his “banning,” coupled to his marriage in 1939 to Mary Brignoli, a member of the communist party, were crucial factors leading to this paradigm change. Finally, the afterlife of “The Bridge” is sketched showing how dismal was its original reception among peers and colleagues.\n\nPermalink: https://carwilb.github.io/teaching/history-anthro-w10.html",

    "text": "The Gift\nMarcel Mauss wrote Essai sur le don (Essay on the Gift) as the main work of L’Année Sociologique of 1923/24. This brief, comparative work is his best known contribution to anthropology and one of the most widely cited anthropological works. As editor of the journal, co-author of multiple works, and as chair of Sociology at the College de France, was key to the growth of social anthropology in France. (And is even credited by Claude Lévi-Strauss with importing the term social anthropology into France.1)\n1 Claude Levi-Strauss, “The Scope of Anthropology,” Current Anthropology 7, no. 2 (1966): 112–23, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2740021.Mauss’s essay reoriented the anthropological study of the circulation of goods, intangible offerings, services, and honors in multiple ways. It widened the scope of “stuff” considered possible to exchange, sets up social collectivities (and also deities) rather than individuals as the participants in these exchanges, recognizes that that which is exchanged is charged with spiritual power, explains that this system morally demands reciprocity, and argues that such reciprocity is the foundation of social relations.\n\nAll these institutions reveal the same kind of social and! psychological pattern. Food, women, children, possessions, charms, land, labour, services, religious offices, rank—every- thing is stuff to be given away and repaid. In perpetual interchange of what we may call spiritual matter, comprising men and things, these elements pass and repass between clans ^and individuals, ranks, sexes and generations.2\n2 Marcel Mauss, The Gift; Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies., trans. Ian Cunnison and E. E. Evans-Pritchard (Free Press, 1954), 11–12.\nThe essay appears within a journal (L’Année Sociologique) that Mauss was resurrecting following World War I and the death of both his uncle and mentor Émile Durkheim and many of his scholarly peers. The entire issue is included in the 2016 translation by Jane Guyer, published by the anthropological collective Hau, which in turn owes its name to the Polynesian concept as explored in the essay.\nSpecifically Māori culture occupies a turning point in the essay, one partly grounded on misinterpretation between anthropologist Elsdon Best and Māori informant and scholarl Tamati Ranapati. Georgina Stewart has critically examined the relationship and the multiple points of cultural communication, miscommunication, and supposition that culminate in “the hau of the gift” as conceptualized by Mauss.\n\nRanapiri was inventing Māori academic writing as he wrote: writing about and in language that hitherto had existed only in oral registers. Other than Ranapiri, only one other scholar of Māori ethnicity, namely Biggs, appears in the history of debate about the hau of the gift.\n\n\nMauss failed to account for the personified Māori cosmos, and ended up invalidly personifying ‘hau’ instead, in his delineation of ‘hau taonga’ as the ‘hau of the gift’—the ‘spirit’ of the object given. In this way, Mauss distorted the Māori concept of hau to serve his preconceived search for universal social truth, and a general theory of exchange.3\n3 Georgina Stewart, “The ‘Hau’of Research: Mauss Meets Kaupapa Māori,” Journal of World Philosophies 2, no. 1 (2017), https://scholarworks.iu.edu/iupjournals/index.php/jwp/article/view/917.\nAmber Nicholson likewise explores the Māori concept of hau in depth using numerous Māori sources.4 In my view, this rich exposition breaks with some anthropological elaborations on the term (which Nicholson maps out in a dramatic side-by-side table with Māori ideas), but still resonates with the concepts of spiritual force, reciprocity, and enmeshment in larger entities emphasized by Mauss.\n4 Amber Nicholson, “Hau: Giving Voices to the Ancestors,” The Journal of the Polynesian Society 128, no. 2 (2019): 137–62, https://www.jstor.org/stable/26857338.There have been three English translations of The Gift:\n\nA 1954 translation by Ian Cunnison, introduced by E. E. Evans-Pritchard.5\nA 1990 translation by W. D. Halls, introduced by Mary Douglas.6\nA 2016 translation by Jane I. Guyer, introduced by Guyer and Bill Maurer.7\n\n5 Mauss, The Gift; Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies.6 Marcel Mauss, The gift: the form and reason for exchange in archaic societies, Routledge classics (Routledge, 2002).7 Marcel Mauss, The gift: Expanded edition, Expanded edition. (HAU Books, 2016).The Gift is written in the tradition of an open-ended essay, and draws many threads across a remarkable sweep of time and geography. This comment from Claude Lévi-Strauss emphasizes the creative and connective, rather than scientific and deductive aspect of such writing:\n\nWithout a doubt, the proof will remain largely illusory: we will never know if the other, with whom we cannot, after all, identify, makes from the elements of his social existence a synthesis exactly superposable on that which we have worked out. But it is not necessary to go so far; all that is needed-and for this, inner feeling is sufficient-is that the synthesis, how- ever approximate, arises from human experience. We must be sure of this, since we study men; and as we are ourselves men, we have that possibility. The way in which Mauss (1950:285) poses and resolves the problem in the Essay on the Gift brings to view, in the intersection of two subjectivities, the nearest order of truth to which the sciences of man can aspire when they confront the wholeness of their object.8\n8 Levi-Strauss, “The Scope of Anthropology,” 114.\nWith that said, The Gift attacks and perhaps overthrows many prior certainties in anthropological studies of the economy, not least of which is the refutation of the existence of a “free gift,” as highlighted in Mary Douglas’s introduction. Think about which ones you find.\n\n\nOn Boundaries: Purity and Danger\nMary Douglas’s Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo9 stands as a historical landmark in the anthropology of religion.\n9 Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An analysis of concept of pollution and taboo, 1st ed. (Routledge, 1966), https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203361832.A signature phrase in it is “matter out of place,” Douglas’ definition of the otherwise form-shifting concept of dirt. She sets up categorization and boundary drawing as a core element of religion. Given this, one need not think of the Kosher laws in Leviticus as primitive hygenic codes, nor of magical incantations as ways of causing miracles.  Rather, she argues, both express ritual concern with maintaining social order.Douglas revises her specific interpretations of Kosher practices in her 2002 introduction.1010 Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concept of Pollution and Taboo (Routledge, 2003), http://www.dawsonera.com/depp/reader/protected/external/AbstractView/S9780203361832.\n\nIt is only by exaggerating the difference between within and without, above and below, male and female, with and against, that a semblance of order is created.\n\nHer chapter on magic and religion confronts and challenges the line of anthropological scholarship on “primitive religion” going back to James Frazer’s The Golden Bough.\n\n\nStructures of Kinship\n\n\n\n\n\n“Although less important than those associated with funerals, the astonishing complexity of the matrimonial exchanges illustrated in Fig. 3 deserves to engage our attention.”\n\n\n11 Claude Lévi-Strauss, The Elementary Structures of Kinship, Rev. ed. (Beacon Press, 1969).In Elementary Structures of Kinship,11 Claude Lévi-Strauss proposes a structuralist explanation for the circulation of spouses mentioned in Mauss’s The Gift. The core insight of the book is to unite the near-universal taboo on incest (in some form) with the complex kinship structures that anthropologists had been mapping since at least Lewis Henry Morgan. (Like Douglas, he rejects the functionalist explanation that incest taboos prevent interbreeding.)\nLévi-Strauss argues that by separating marriageable from un-marriageable individuals, kinship systems generate the necessary boundaries for lineages that are the collective social actors which exchange spouses—glossed in his account, as in Mauss’s brief phrase, exclusively as women.\nGayle Rubin will build upon Elementary Structures of Kinship in her pivotal essay “The Traffic in Women,”12 which theorizes kinship and gender systems as integrated whole, subject to historical change, and as systems of power.\n12 Gayle Rubin, The Traffic in Women: Towards a Political Economy of Sex, ed. Rayna Reiterc (Monthly Review Press, 1975).\nAnd if men have been sexual subjects—exchangers—and women sexual semi-objects—gifts—for much of human history, then a great many customs, clichés, and personality traits seem to make a great deal of sense (among others, the curious custom by which a father gives away a bride).\n\nThis essay proves foundational to Gender Studies. Both Rubin and Judith Butler will bring vast inquiries into gender, the body, and sexuality into dialogue with Lévi-Strauss’ account.\nPermalink: https://carwilb.github.io/teaching/history-anthro-w12.html",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Franz Boas and Paul Rivet, two long-distance friends and foundational colleagues in their discipline,1 each published major works around the same time that analyzed thousands of skulls using conventional anthropometric techniques. But these works, published on opposite sides of the Atlantic each upended long-held assumptions about racial types and the heritability of physical traits.\n1 Christine Laurière, “Anthropology and Politics, the Beginnings: The Relations between Franz Boas and Paul Rivet (1919-42),” Histories of anthropology annual 6, no. 1 (2010): 225–52, https://doi.org/10.1353/haa.2010.0004.Boas’s 1912 article “Changes in Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants” analyzed the cranial measurements of around 18,000 children and young adults and found that the then-accepted measure of cranial form — the cephalic index — varied significantly between American immigrants and first-generation children of American immigrants, and also between families with different numbers of children:\n\nAmerican-born descendants of immigrants differ in type from their foreign-born parents. The changes which occur among various European types are not all in the same direction. They develop in early childhood and persist throughout life. … Foreign-born parents when compared with their own foreign- born and American-born children exhibit the same types of differences for the children as the whole series.2\n2 Franz Boas, “Changes in the Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants,” American Anthropologist 14, no. 3 (1912): 530–62, https://doi.org/10.1525/aa.1912.14.3.02a00080.\n\n\n\nBoas’ description of his sample population, stratified by ethnicity and age\n\n\nRivet’s 1909-10 study, released in a serial fashion in the journal L’Anthropologie (1909|1910), analyzed the cranial measurements of over 6,000 individuals from around the world, including a substantial number of non-human primates. In this case the variable in question was prognathism, defined as “the protrusion of the upper or lower jaw … [measured as] the facial angle (the slope of a line from forehead to jaw).”3\n3 Alice L. Conklin, In the Museum of Man: Race, Anthropology, and Empire in France, 1850–1950 (Cornell University Press, 2013), 63, https://doi.org/10.7591/9780801469046.\nII suffit de parcourir ce tableau, pour constater qu’il n’y a qu’un rapport trés lointain entre l’ordre dans lequel s’y inscrivent les diverses populations et celui qu’on aurait obtenuen les classant d’aprés leur degré d’évolution intellectuelle ou matérielle. Certes, dune fagon trés générale, les races blanches se rangent parmi les plus orthognathes et les races noires et rouges parmi les plus prognathes, mais les exceptions abondent.\nOne need only glance at this table to see that there is only a very distant relationship between the order in which the various populations are listed and the order that would have been obtained by classifying them according to their degree of intellectual or material evolution. Admittedly, in very general terms, white races are among the most orthognathic and black and red races among the most prognathic, but there are many exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in the same article, Rivet explicitly rejects the idea that prognathism is a marker of racial inferiority:\n\nPar contre, j’espére avoir prouvé qu’il ne faut pas lui attribuer Vimportance qu’on a été tenté parfois de lui donner en tant que caractere sériaire et qu’on ne doit surtout pas le considérer comme un caractére d’infériorité.\nOn the other hand, I hope I have demonstrated that we should not attribute to it the importance that we have sometimes been tempted to give it as a serious character trait, and that we should certainly not consider it a sign of inferiority.\n\nBoas and Rivet were two of the early twentieth century scientists who were “wrestling with many of the … methodological and conceptual problems in race science.”4 As we’ve seen in class, some scientists would react to the lack of supportive evidence for profound racial difference, much less racial inferiority, with disbelief, and others with steady confidence that the necessary data were forthcoming.\n4 Conklin, In the Museum of Man, 64.5 Manifesto by 1,284 Noted u.s. Scientists Denounces Racialism, Fascist Position on Science, n.d., https://www.jta.org/archive/manifesto-by-1284-noted-u-s-scientists-denounces-racialism-fascist-position-on-science.Boas and Rivet were two scholars who eventually concluded that the evidence was lacking for racial difference and turned their eye towards racism as both an object of study and political target. Ultimately, Boas would organize 1,284 scientists from 167 universities to sign a joint manifesto in December 1938 to, in his words, “declare that we scientists have the moral obligation to educate the American people against all false and unscientific doctrines, such as the racial nonsense of the Nazis.”5\nCraniometry’s collapse as a racial measure is documented in Paul Turbull’s recent chapter “Surveying Craniometry.”6 Boas’ engagement with race is the subject of a chapter of Lee Baker’s From Savage to Negro.7 Rivet’s studies of craniometry are described in Christine Laurière’s biography of Rivet.8\n6 Paul Turnbull, Surveying Craniometry (Routledge, 2023).7 Lee D Baker, From Savage to Negro: Anthropology and the Construction of Race, 1896-1954 (University of California Press, 1998).8 Christine Laurière, Se faire un nom, Archives (Publications scientifiques du Muséum, 2008), 167–209, https://books.openedition.org/mnhn/2401.9 Bronwen Douglas, Climate to Crania:: Science and the Racialization of Human Difference, ed.

As with other markers, cranial measurements can be useful for tracing population-level relationships and migration, something both Boas and Rivet suspected based on their data.14\n13 John H.

    "text": "Carwil Bjork-James is the principal investigator of Ultimate Consequences, a digital archive on death in Bolivian political conflict and the author of The Sovereign Street: Making Revolution in Urban Bolivia.. He is a cultural anthropologist who conducts immersive and historical research on disruptive protest, environmental struggles, state violence, and indigenous collective rights. He is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and of Law at Vanderbilt University.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, Prof. Bjork-James conducted ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews on social movements, race and space, protest tactics, and political change in Cochabamba, Sucre, and La Paz, resulting in a monograph, The Sovereign Street, and articles including \"Binding Leaders to the Community\" (Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 2018), \"Race and the Right to Speak for the City: Political Violence in Bolivia's 2006–2009 Stalemate\" (UAS, 2019), \"Unarmed Militancy\" (American Anthropologist, 2020). Using both anthropological and historical methods, The Sovereign Street explores how pivotal public events generate political legitimacy, contribute to major (sometimes revolutionary) transformations in the balance of power, and provide models for future political action. The ethnographic evidence collected about these events—of social life as experienced through the human body, the meanings attached to places, and social movement practices—explains how grassroots movements exert leverage upon the state through protest.\nUltimate Consequences is supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and a Digital Humanities Incubation Grant from Vanderbilt University. Drawing on the database, Prof. Bjork-James wrote an expert witness report for the plaintiffs in Mamani et al. v. Sánchez de Lozada et al., the first US Federal case to hold a head of state liable for human rights violations, and the white paper \"Mass Protest and State Repression in Bolivian Political Culture\" (Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, 2020). His published scholarship has also addressed the evolving international human rights regime, social movement interventions into global governance, anti-indigenous racism and state violence in eastern Colombia, and socio-environmental conflicts and state environmental policy in the Andes."

    "text": "Stephanie Black\n\n\nThese pieces about Stephanie Black’s 2001 film provide more context about the director, the film, and her artistic and political intentions.\n\n“Life and Debt: Interview with Stephanie Black” by Cynthia Fuchs, Nitrate Online, 14 December 2001.\nGeorge Sanchez, “Revealing the Transparent: Stephanie Black Unveils the Jamaican World Beyond Tourism,” Friction Magazine, 2002.\nOfficial film website: http://www.lifeanddebt.org/about.html\n\nSpeaking to Cynthia Fuchs about her motivations for portraying tourism in the film, Black explained:\n\nThe genesis of the film came in the 1990s, when I spent time in Jamaica. Every day in the Jamaican Gleaner, the national newspaper, there were front page stories about some payment that wasn’t being released because Jamaica didn’t devalue rapidly enough or privatize quickly enough, or do drug-trafficking to the satisfaction of the United States. And these stories were repeated again and again. I was in shock because I had thought the IMF was something like the Red Cross. I didn’t think they were that controlling, that they would have that kind of impact on the day-to-day running of the country. So I wondered how much autonomy the country had, if the outside forces had such influence on the really important policy-making. As I began to speak to people, and as is articulated in the film, everyone knows what’s going on, in all classes, and yet, I, as a decently educated American, had no idea that this was going on. And that’s how the tourist came to be — I wanted to ask why I had no idea what was happening. The tourist is a metaphor for privilege and lack of understanding. Jamaica needs to reinvent itself to meet the needs of the visitors. Consider the case of dance lessons: it could be that once, you visited a country and would go to a little bar and see people dance, and try out the new moves yourself; now, it’s all contained in a little area, and spoon-fed in a soulless way.\n\n\nBut at the same time, [the use of the tourists] is not just a criticism; I’m not just making fun of the Americans. I identify with them. I felt that there’s a certain victimization in lack of knowledge, that I myself am part of. So the tourists are a metaphor for the lack of understanding, of our own policies, imposed in our name. I spoke to Jamaicans who work in hotels about the most absurd questions they get. And there were people would come to the island and not even know they were in a foreign country. Very often, the first question they would get is, “Where’s the McDonald’s?” And along with that, there’s the adaptation of the Jamaica Kincaid text (A Small Place,1 written in 1987 about Kincaid’s own home, Antigua), and she uses a very militant, passionate voice to describe a postcolonial consciousness. I was interested, now that we’ve all accepted that colonization is wrong, to apply her postcolonial text to a neocolonial situation, and see how accurate it remains.",

Several of you mentioned its effects in your commentaries. Here are some further resources on the issue:\n\nIn 2011, a Chinese government statement (original in Chinese) acknowledged the mixed results of the project. As translated by International Rivers and The Guardian of London: “The project is now greatly benefiting the society in the aspects of flood prevention, power generation, river transportation and water resource utilization,” the government maintained, but “there are problems that must be urgently resolved in the resettlement and wealth-making of immigrants, environmental protection and geological disaster prevention.”\nInternational Rivers—an international network of environmentalists and community campaigners working on large-scale dams and their consequences—has their own, rather more critical take on the project: “Three Gorges Dam: A Model of the Past.”\nMajor flooding in 2012 highlighted the still controversial role of the dam in flood prevention and management. A summary of the various perspectives on how the dam fared is provided by China Dialogue here.\nAn 2013 assessment of the dam’s environmental impact finds that official government studies under-estimated most but not all areas of concern (see Table 3).\nChina’s large dams are displacing some of the country’s large coal imports, according to reporting by Bloomberg News.\n\n\n\n\nThree Gorges Dam in September 2009",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The second week’s readings tries to capture the “dawn” of anthropology in the Western Hemisphere (or perhaps the world engaged by European colonialism). It works not so much by seeking out the first sources chronologically as by capturing the range of different possible voices describing human and cultural others.1\n1 Carwil Bjork-James, Indigenous March in Defense of Isiboro Sécure Arrives in La Paz, Challenges Evo Morales Government (Background Briefing), October 16, 2011.\n\n\n\nCover of Las Casas’ A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (Seville, 1552)\n\n\n2 Bartolomé de las Casas, Bartolomé de las Casas and the defense of Amerindian rights: a brief history with documents, Atlantic crossings (The University of Alabama Press, 2020).3 Holger Henke and Fred Reńo, Modern Political Culture in the Caribbean (University of the West Indies Press, 2003).\nChronologically, the readings begin with the 16th century Spanish friar and missionary Bartolomé de las Casas (1484-1566), who wrote about the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and Central America.2 Las Casas is often credited as one of the first advocates for indigenous rights in the Americas, and his writings provide a critical perspective on the brutal treatment of native populations by European colonizers. Lewis Hanke3 profiles Las Casas as an anthropologist, specifically focusing on “his approach to the study of cultures so alien to his own” who used “the vast amount of material he had patiently gathered on various aspects of Indian life” to “understand the importance of their customs and beliefs within the framework of their own culture.”\nChristian Feest profiles4 early European reactions to Aztec and Mesoamerican art brought to Europe in 1521, the moment when the Spanish invasion of the Aztec empire was still ongoing. Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) is one of the first Europeans to react to Mesoamerican art, and he did so highly positively noting, “And yet I have all days of my life seen nothing that has thus delighted my heart as these things. For I have seen among them wonderful artificial things and have wondered at the subtle ingenia of the people in foreign lands.”\n4 Christian F. Feest, A First European Assessment of Indigenous American Art, 1992.5 Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca, A Brief Description of All the Western Indies, ed. Kris Lane, Neil L. Whitehead, Jo Ellen Fair, and Leigh A. Payne (Duke University Press, 2008), 165–212, https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780822389064-010/html.Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca5 (1557-1622) took a different view, situating his descriptive work on “the Western Indies” (the Americas, but largely South America) alongside a manual of advice for Spanish soldiers and colonizers and a polemical defense of the conquest against critics like Las Casas.\nIn American Pentimiento,6 Patricia Seed reflects on Iberian and English descriptions of indigenous peoples in the Americas. She argues that these texts should be read not as straightforward ethnographic accounts but also texts shaped around the need to provide religious and moral justifications for the appropriation of indigenous lands and labor. The optional chapter, “Sustaining Political Identities” summarizes the overall argument of her book, while “Cannibals” details this storytelling in Spanish America.\n6 Patricia Seed, American Pentimento: The Invention of Indians and the Pursuit of Riches (University of Minnesota Press, 2001).7 Roger Williams, A key into the language of America (Bedford, MA : Applewood Books, 1997), http://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wOfpAPRxlVYC.8 Sarah Vowell, The Wordy Shipmates (Penguin, 2009).9 Ana González, Roger Williams and the Pequot War, n.d., https://explore.thepublicsradio.org/stories/roger-williams-and-the-pequot-war/.In the English colonization of North America (note that colonization precedes the 1706-07 union forming Great Britain), Roger Williams, the Puritan founder of Rhode Island, is among the first to publish an ethnographic text, A Key into the Language of America (1643).7 The excerpt from Sarah Vowell’s The Wordy Shipmates8 narrates this multivocal text as well as the Pequot War that preceded its publication. This podcast9 focuses on Roger Williams’ direct participation in the Pequot War.\n\n\n\nContemporary woodcut illustration of the Mystic massacre\n\n\nFinally, the first three chapters of Amitav Ghosh’s The Nutmeg’s Curse10 situate the contemporaneous events of the Pequot war and the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands in 1621-22. Ghosh’s up-close look at early colonial violence speaks to the decisions behind colonial violence as well as the interrelations among different colonial projects and the internal religious wars of Europe. The chapter that follows argues that the colonization of indigenous lands is also interrelated with the de-sacralization of nature in Europe through the scientific revolution.\n\n\n10 Amitav Ghosh, The nutmeg’s curse: Parables for a planet in crisis (University of Chicago Press, 2021).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Margaret Mead’s generation lived through the most rapid period of change in human history, before or since. People born in 1901, like her, had entered world that was still lit by candles, gas lamps, and kerosene lanterns a world in which heavier-than-air flight was reckoned “a vain fantasy,” China was an ancient dynastic empire, the British Empire covered nearly one fourth of the planet’s land area, no nation allowed women to vote, and hundreds of thousands still carried the living memory of being enslaved. And the youthful, utopian Margaret Mead of the 1920s and 1930s had been almost unique in predicting the scope of the changes to come. While her peers continued to imagine the future as one dominated by Western empires and by traditional social norms, she predicted an age of upheaval that would alter the experience of being human itself—an era of transformed consciousness. —Benjamin Breen1\n1 Benjamin Breen, Tripping on utopia: Margaret Mead, the Cold War, and the troubled birth of psychedelic science, First edition. (Grand Central Publishing, Hachette Book Group, 2024), 266.\nMargaret Mead already had her PhD in hand when she traveled across the United States (by train with Ruth Benedict) and then further from San Francisco to Honolulu and onward to Samoa in 1925. Her fieldwork there on adolescent sexuality, published in Coming of Age in Samoa2 generated extensive publicity and launched her career as a public intellectual. Her subsequent work in Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies3 profiled three New Guinea cultures with distinct gender systems, and explored the question of what happens when an individual’s emotional disposition is at odd’s with society’s gender expectations.\nMead’s social relevance and ultimately the popularity of her work is largely a product of her ability to present ethnographic conclusions as relevant to American society, rather than a collection of curiosities that describe peoples seen as primitive and lesser. We can see in this an intellectual move to position ethnographic expertise as a resource for understanding all human societies, including her own. However, it’s also worth taking the time to read Mead’s latter chapters of these works as ethnographic treatment’s of Western culture in their own right.\nAt the start of World War II, Mead joined in a group of four anthropologists – Ruth Benedict, Gregory Bateson, and Geoffrey Gorer – in the Committee for National Morale. “From the first we felt it was only a matter of time before this country would be drawn into the conflict, and we hoped to put our growing knowledge of the human sciences at the services of the Allied fight against Nazism.” Mead’s main contribution was And Keep Your Powder Dry. In her introduction to a 1965 reprint, Mead looked back both on her practice of writing about Western culture in the final chapters of her previous books and on the sudden challenge of constructing an ethnographic description of her own culture.\nMead’s early work in Samoa ad New Guinea became the subject of a series of controversies, most visibly Derek Freeman’s 1983 Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth. However, Freeman’s argument that Mead had been misled by her Samoan interviewees has largely been discredited in the discipline.\nOther controversies of interpretation surround the particular characterizations of the three cultures profiled in Sex and Temperament, where they interlock with the personal lives of Mead and her collaborators Reo Fortune and Gregory Bateson, the former her husband at the time of that fieldwork and the latter her future spouse. David Lipset reviews Mead’s work and rival interpretations in “Rereading Margaret Mead’s Sepik Triptych and its Ethnographic Critics.”6 Lise M. Dobrin and Ira Bashkow’s “The Truth in Anthropology Does Not Travel First Class”7 exposes the four-way correspondence behind Mead’s break with Fortune while defending the latter’s read of local mythology.\nMead was active in the American Association of Anthropology, and its elected president in 1975. During the 1960s and 1970s, this pitted her in a generational struggle between older anthropologists like herself who had taken involvement in the US government’s overseas empire as a routine pre-requisite for their work, and a younger generation that was staunchly against the Vietnam War and developing a critique of anthropology’s implication in colonialism. (Mead and Bateson had both been involved with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II, with Bateson’s involvement considerably deeper and extending to covert service in South Asia. However, he would more publicly repudiate this course by the late 1960s.) Eric Wolf, then a rising star in the discipline, publicly confronted Mead at the 1971 AAA meeting over her ethics report downplaying American social scientists’ collaboration in the Vietnam war effort, which had been exposed by a student report.8\nMead’s overall legacy was the subject of a 1992 book and a 2003 conference at the Barnard Center for Research on Women. The speeches from the latter are collected as an issue of Scholar and Feminist Online.9 Leonora Foerstel and Angela Gilliam’s Confronting the Margaret Mead Legacy: Scholarship, Empire, and the South Pacific represents the primary example of post/anticolonial critique of Mead’s work. As Foerstel observes:\nThree of the authors are scholars at the University of Papua New Guinea. The co-editors also narrate the Mead-Wolf-Vietnam controversy in chapter 5.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nick Dearden writing in The Guardian (London) offers an overall update on Jamaica, debt and development,1 which continues to be heavily shaped by the neoliberal policies described in Life and Debt. Some highlights of his description:\n1 Nick Dearden, “Jamaica’s Decades of Debt Are Damaging Its Future,” The Guardian, April 16, 2013, https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/16/jamaica-decades-debt-damaging-future.\nOver 40 years, Jamaica has been “rescued” on countless occasions. In the 1980s, the island became almost a byword for “structural adjustment”. Jamaica is one of the most indebted countries, spends twice as much on debt repayments as it does on education and health combined, and looks set to miss several millennium development goals.\nThere has been no progress in cutting hunger, or increasing basic water and sanitation provision. In 1990, 97% of children completed primary school. Now only 73% do. In 1990, 59 mothers died in childbirth for every 100,000 children born. Now it is 110.\nJamaica has repaid more money ($19.8bn) than it has been lent ($18.5bn), yet the government still “owes” $7.8bn, as a result of huge interest payments. Government foreign debt payments ($1.2bn) are double the amount spent on education and health combined ($600m).\nJamaica is not alone. Several Caribbean countries are also dangerously indebted. The IMF itself says (pdf): “Since growth in the current environment is virtually non-existent, significant fiscal consolidation is inevitable, but may not be enough to bring down such high debt levels.” Translation: countries like Jamaica need to make deep cuts, but because there is and will be no growth, the debt will remain.\n\nA summary of lessons from the four-decade relationship between Jamaica and the IMF is available from Michael Witter, an economic policy expert who appears in the film. Witter advises, “The negotiators for the IMF and the Government of Jamaica must realise that the strategies pursued for the past 39 years are unlikely to stimulate economic growth in 2012, all the more because of the mountain of debt, the harshly competitive international economy of today, and the probability of severe weather events.” Dr. Witter is also interviewed here.\n\n\n\n\n\nJamaican Banknote depicting Michael Manley. Michael Manley appears on the 1000-Jamaican-dollar note, currently valued at slightly less that US$9.\n\n\nDevaluation continues to be a major part of economic policy. Where US dollars were worth $1.41 Jamaican dollars in 1978, they now buy 112 Jamaican dollars.\n\nApparel Sector\nThe assembly of clothing as depicted in the film’s segments on the Kingston Free Zone has collapsed in Jamaica. Even before the Great Recession the decline was steep: “Between 2003 and the start of the financial downturn in 2007, exports of apparel from Jamaica fell 87 per cent, declining from US$11.4 million ($1billion) to US$1.5 million ($133.5 million).” (Jamaican Observer)\n\n\nDairy Sector\nAs illustrated in the film, milk powder imports continued to displace Jamaica’s local dairy industry, which seems to have bottomed out in the last few years. The Jamaican government reports:\n\nLocal milk production peaked at 38.8 million litres in 1992 and has been consistently declining since, except for the period 1996 – 1999, to 12.2 million litres in 2010. Production has varied between 12 and 13 million litres since 2010, with production in 2013 at 12.34 million litres. As an indicator of nutritional status, Jamaicans are not drinking enough milk for a normal healthy life. Per capita consumption of milk remains at 105 ml/day . This is one – third of the average for Latin America and the Caribbean; one – fifth of the average for developed countries ; slightly less than the average of other developing countries; and half of The World Health Organisation minimum requirement.\n\n\n\n“You still have tourism” and remittances\nJamaica’s tourist sector is the vital heart of its economy. The Tourism Board claims that it accounts “directly … for over 10 percent of all jobs on the island in 2007 and indirectly for some 26 percent of all jobs. Tourism generates more than 50 percent of all foreign exchange earnings of the country.”\nJamaica’s trade deficit is partially balanced by earnings from 2 million stay-over tourists and 1.27 million cruise ship passengers who come to the island. However, it also depends on $2.26 billion (US) in remittances sent home by Jamaicans living abroad, according World Bank estimates. These money flows compensate for the imbalance between Jamica’s $1.8 billion in exports and $6.44 billion in imports. (These are the components of Jamaica’s trade.)\nIncidentally, global remittances sent home to developing countries are over three times as large as all foreign development aid put together.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Franz Boas and Paul Rivet, two long-distance friends and foundational colleagues in their discipline,1 each published major works around the same time that analyzed thousands of skulls using conventional anthropometric techniques. But these works, published on opposite sides of the Atlantic each upended long-held assumptions about racial types and the heritability of physical traits.\n1 Christine Laurière, “Anthropology and Politics, the Beginnings: The Relations between Franz Boas and Paul Rivet (1919-42),” Histories of anthropology annual 6, no. 1 (2010): 225252, https://doi.org/10.1353/haa.2010.0004.Boas’s 1912 article “Changes in Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants” analyzed the cranial measurements of around 18,000 children and young adults and found that the then-accepted measure of cranial form — the cephalic index — varied significantly between American immigrants and first-generation children of American immigrants, and also between families with different numbers of children:\n\nAmerican-born descendants of immigrants differ in type from their foreign-born parents. The changes which occur among various European types are not all in the same direction. They develop in early childhood and persist throughout life. … Foreign-born parents when compared with their own foreign- born and American-born children exhibit the same types of differences for the children as the whole series.2\n2 Franz Boas, “Changes in the Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants,” American Anthropologist 14, no. 3 (1912): 530–62, https://doi.org/10.1525/aa.1912.14.3.02a00080.\n\n\n\nBoas’ description of his sample population, stratified by ethnicity and age\n\n\nRivet’s 1909-10 study, released in a serial fashion in the journal L’Anthropologie (1909|1910), analyzed the cranial measurements of over 6,000 individuals from around the world, including a substantial number of non-human primates. In this case the variable in question was prognathism, defined as “the protrusion of the upper or lower jaw … [measured as] the facial angle (the slope of a line from forehead to jaw).”3\n3 Alice L. Conklin, In the Museum of Man: Race, Anthropology, and Empire in France, 18501950 (Cornell University Press, 2013), 63, https://doi.org/10.7591/9780801469046.\nII suffit de parcourir ce tableau, pour constater qu’il n’y a qu’un rapport trés lointain entre l’ordre dans lequel s’y inscrivent les diverses populations et celui qu’on aurait obtenuen les classant d’aprés leur degré d’évolution intellectuelle ou matérielle. Certes, dune fagon trés générale, les races blanches se rangent parmi les plus orthognathes et les races noires et rouges parmi les plus prognathes, mais les exceptions abondent.\nOne need only glance at this table to see that there is only a very distant relationship between the order in which the various populations are listed and the order that would have been obtained by classifying them according to their degree of intellectual or material evolution. Admittedly, in very general terms, white races are among the most orthognathic and black and red races among the most prognathic, but there are many exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in the same article, Rivet explicitly rejects the idea that prognathism is a marker of racial inferiority:\n\nPar contre, j’espére avoir prouvé qu’il ne faut pas lui attribuer Vimportance qu’on a été tenté parfois de lui donner en tant que caractere sériaire et qu’on ne doit surtout pas le considérer comme un caractére d’infériorité.\nOn the other hand, I hope I have demonstrated that we should not attribute to it the importance that we have sometimes been tempted to give it as a serious character trait, and that we should certainly not consider it a sign of inferiority.\n\nBoas and Rivet were two of the early twentieth century scientists who were “wrestling with many of the … methodological and conceptual problems in race science.”4 As we’ve seen in class, some scientists would react to the lack of supportive evidence for profound racial difference, much less racial inferiority, with disbelief, and others with steady confidence that the necessary data were forthcoming.\n4 Conklin, In the Museum of Man, 64.5 Manifesto by 1,284 Noted u.s. Scientists Denounces Racialism, Fascist Position on Science, n.d., https://www.jta.org/archive/manifesto-by-1284-noted-u-s-scientists-denounces-racialism-fascist-position-on-science.Boas and Rivet were two scholars who eventually concluded that the evidence was lacking for racial difference and turned their eye towards racism as both an object of study and political target. Ultimately, Boas would organize 1,284 scientists from 167 universities to sign a joint manifesto in December 1938 to, in his words, “declare that we scientists have the moral obligation to educate the American people against all false and unscientific doctrines, such as the racial nonsense of the Nazis.”5\nCraniometry’s collapse as a racial measure is documented in Paul Turbull’s recent chapter “Surveying Craniometry.”6 Boas’ engagement with race is the subject of a chapter of Lee Baker’s From Savage to Negro.7 Rivet’s studies of craniometry are described in Christine Laurière’s biography of Rivet.8\n6 Paul Turnbull, Surveying Craniometry (Routledge, 2023).7 Lee D Baker, From Savage to Negro: Anthropology and the Construction of Race, 1896-1954 (University of California Press, 1998).8 Christine Laurière, Se faire un nom, Archives (Publications scientifiques du Muséum, 2008), 167–209, https://books.openedition.org/mnhn/2401.9 Bronwen Douglas, Climate to Crania:: Science and the Racialization of Human Difference, ed.

As with other markers, cranial measurements can be useful for tracing population-level relationships and migration, something both Boas and Rivet suspected based on their data.14\n13 John H.
