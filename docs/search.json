    "text": "Carwil Bjork-James is a cultural anthropologist who conducts immersive and historical research on disruptive protest, environmental struggles, state violence, and indigenous collective rights. He is the principal investigator of Ultimate Consequences, a digital archive on death in Bolivian political conflict, and author of The Sovereign Street: Making Revolution in Urban Bolivia. He is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and of Law at Vanderbilt University.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, he conducted ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews on social movements, race and space, protest tactics, and political change in Cochabamba, Sucre, and La Paz, resulting in a monograph, The Sovereign Street, and articles including “Binding Leaders to the Community” (Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 2018), “Race and the Right to Speak for the City: Political Violence in Bolivia’s 2006–2009 Stalemate” (UAS, 2019), “Unarmed Militancy” (American Anthropologist, 2020). Using both anthropological and historical methods, The Sovereign Street explores how pivotal public events generate political legitimacy, contribute to major (sometimes revolutionary) transformations in the balance of power, and provide models for future political action. The ethnographic evidence collected about these events—of social life as experienced through the human body, the meanings attached to places, and social movement practices—explains how grassroots movements exert leverage upon the state through protest.\nUltimate Consequences is a quantitative and qualitative database, unique in its depth and completeness of coverage, of all conflict deaths in Bolivia since October 1982. It is supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and a Digital Humanities Incubation Grant from Vanderbilt University. Drawing on the database, Prof. Bjork-James wrote an expert witness report for the plaintiffs in Mamani et al. v. Sánchez de Lozada et al., the first US Federal case to hold a head of state liable for human rights violations, and the white paper “Mass Protest and State Repression in Bolivian Political Culture” (Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, 2020). His published scholarship has addressed the evolving international human rights regime, social movement interventions into global governance, anti-indigenous racism and state violence in eastern Colombia, and socio-environmental conflicts and state environmental policy in the Andes.",

    "text": "Spectral Traces: Unveiling Power through Engaged Research on Violence\nIn alignment with this year’s AAA theme of “Ghosts,” this panel explores how research on individual deaths and acts of violence intersects with exposing larger systems of power. By examining specific instances of state and political violence, we aim to illuminate the structural forces that perpetuate cycles of oppression, displacement, and human rights abuses across diverse contexts.\nOur panelists investigate how communities grapple with the aftermath of violence, from engagement with grassroots movements to state-sanctioned forensic investigations. We consider the ways in which death, loss, and sacrifice are imbued with social and political meaning, often becoming rallying points for resistance and transformation. The panel delves into the complex relationships between violence and care, exploring how sites of trauma can be reclaimed and repurposed by affected communities.\nCentral to our discussion is the role of memory and commemoration in confronting past atrocities. We examine how societies navigate the liminal spaces between remembering and forgetting, and how mapping and documenting violent events can serve as both a scientific endeavor and a form of social mobilization. The panel also addresses the challenges of seeking justice and remedy in the wake of displacement and state violence, considering both formal legal processes and grassroots initiatives.\nBy focusing on specific case studies from Latin America and the Caribbean, we aim to draw broader conclusions about the nature of political violence and its long-term impacts on individuals and communities. Our interdisciplinary approach combines anthropological, historical, and forensic methodologies to uncover the often invisible structures that underpin systems of oppression.\nKey themes include:\n\nThe mobilization of death and sacrifice in social movements\nTransformation of spaces associated with state violence\nThe intersection of science, law, and community action in human rights investigations\nMapping and memorialization as tools for confronting past atrocities\nThe social history and ongoing consequences of forced displacement\nGrassroots and state-led approaches to transitional justice\n\nThrough these diverse yet interconnected topics, we seek to contribute to ongoing debates about historical memory, accountability, and the enduring legacies of political violence. By examining the “ghostly” remnants of past conflicts and their contemporary manifestations, we hope to shed light on pathways toward healing, justice, and societal transformation.",

    "title": "When did anthropology begin in the Western Hemisphere?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The second week’s readings tries to capture the “dawn” of anthropology in the Western Hemisphere (or perhaps the world engaged by European colonialism). It works not so much by seeking out the first sources chronologically as by capturing the range of different possible voices describing human and cultural others.1\n1 Carwil Bjork-James, Indigenous March in Defense of Isiboro Sécure Arrives in La Paz, Challenges Evo Morales Government (Background Briefing), October 16, 2011.\n\n\n\nCover of Las Casas’ A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (Seville, 1552)\n\n\n2 Bartolomé de las Casas, Bartolomé de las Casas and the defense of Amerindian rights: a brief history with documents, Atlantic crossings (The University of Alabama Press, 2020).3 Holger Henke and Fred Reńo, Modern Political Culture in the Caribbean (University of the West Indies Press, 2003).\nChronologically, the readings begin with the 16th century Spanish friar and missionary Bartolomé de las Casas (1484-1566), who wrote about the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and Central America.2 Las Casas is often credited as one of the first advocates for indigenous rights in the Americas, and his writings provide a critical perspective on the brutal treatment of native populations by European colonizers. Lewis Hanke3 profiles Las Casas as an anthropologist, specifically focusing on “his approach to the study of cultures so alien to his own” who used “the vast amount of material he had patiently gathered on various aspects of Indian life” to “understand the importance of their customs and beliefs within the framework of their own culture.”\nChristian Feest profiles4 early European reactions to Aztec and Mesoamerican art brought to Europe in 1521, the moment when the Spanish invasion of the Aztec empire was still ongoing. Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) is one of the first Europeans to react to Mesoamerican art, and he did so highly positively noting, “And yet I have all days of my life seen nothing that has thus delighted my heart as these things. For I have seen among them wonderful artificial things and have wondered at the subtle ingenia of the people in foreign lands.”\n4 Christian F. Feest, A First European Assessment of Indigenous American Art, 1992.5 Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca, A Brief Description of All the Western Indies, ed. Kris Lane, Neil L. Whitehead, Jo Ellen Fair, and Leigh A. Payne (Duke University Press, 2008), 165–212, https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780822389064-010/html.Captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca5 (1557-1622) took a different view, situating his descriptive work on “the Western Indies” (the Americas, but largely South America) alongside a manual of advice for Spanish soldiers and colonizers and a polemical defense of the conquest against critics like Las Casas.\nIn American Pentimiento,6 Patricia Seed reflects on Iberian and English descriptions of indigenous peoples in the Americas. She argues that these texts should be read not as straightforward ethnographic accounts but also texts shaped around the need to provide religious and moral justifications for the appropriation of indigenous lands and labor. The optional chapter, “Sustaining Political Identities” summarizes the overall argument of her book, while “Cannibals” details this storytelling in Spanish America.\n6 Patricia Seed, American Pentimento: The Invention of Indians and the Pursuit of Riches (University of Minnesota Press, 2001).7 Roger Williams, A key into the language of America (Bedford, MA : Applewood Books, 1997), http://archive.org/details/bub_gb_wOfpAPRxlVYC.8 Sarah Vowell, The Wordy Shipmates (Penguin, 2009).9 Ana González, Roger Williams and the Pequot War, n.d., https://explore.thepublicsradio.org/stories/roger-williams-and-the-pequot-war/.In the English colonization of North America (note that colonization precedes the 1706-07 union forming Great Britain), Roger Williams, the Puritan founder of Rhode Island, is among the first to publish an ethnographic text, A Key into the Language of America (1643).7 The excerpt from Sarah Vowell’s The Wordy Shipmates8 narrates this multivocal text as well as the Pequot War that preceded its publication. This podcast9 focuses on Roger Williams’ direct participation in the Pequot War.\n\n\n\nContemporary woodcut illustration of the Mystic massacre\n\n\nFinally, the first three chapters of Amitav Ghosh’s The Nutmeg’s Curse10 situate the contemporaneous events of the Pequot war and the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands in 1621-22. Ghosh’s up-close look at early colonial violence speaks to the decisions behind colonial violence as well as the interrelations among different colonial projects and the internal religious wars of Europe. The chapter that follows argues that the colonization of indigenous lands is also interrelated with the de-sacralization of nature in Europe through the scientific revolution.\n\n\n10 Amitav Ghosh, The nutmeg’s curse: Parables for a planet in crisis (University of Chicago Press, 2021).",

    "title": "Anthropology and the Enlightenment",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This week’s readings attempt to capture anthropological thinking at the moment when Enlightenment thought is seeding the formation of the modern research university. While it will take some further decades for “the science of man” to escape from Natural History and take its place alongside other social scientific disciplines in the Western Academy, essential foundation for all three of these elements in that story (anthropology, the research university, and the social sciences) were all being laid around 1800.\nThis larger story is the reason why we return to Eric Wolf’s “Introduction” to Europe and the People Without History1 this week. Wolf’s book attempts a six-century account of global processes in which both colonizing and colonized societies were radically transformed and his introduction make the theoretical case that the often-presumed object of anthropological study, distinct “traditional societies,” each with their own “culture,” is an illusion.\n1 Eric R. Wolf, Introduction (Univ. of California Press, 1982).\nBy turning names into things we create false models of reality. By endowing nations, societies, or cultures with the qualities of internally homogeneous and externally distinctive and bounded objects, we create a model of the world as a global pool hall in which the entities spin off each other like so many hard and round billiard balls. Thus it becomes easy to sort the world into differently colored balls… (6)\n\nRelevantly for this week, Wolf describes “The Rise of the Social Sciences” in an argument which is more of an intellectual lament than a chronological account. For Wolf, sociology, political science, and economics are incomplete disciplines, which artificially sever certain relationships from the broader whole, most crucially by failing to take an integrated look at political economy. He notes that sociology was initially a political project aimed at fostering social cohesion (on this point, see more directly Mostajir2), and that political science and economics have been oriented around formal models of their spheres of interest that leave out that which is crucial.\n2 Parysa Mostajir, Social Physics, Industrialization, and the French Revolution, n.d., https://voices.uchicago.edu/pmostajir/2020/10/19/history-of-social-science-lecture-4-social-science-industrialization-and-the-french-revolution/.3 Immanuel Kant, “Beantwortung Der Frage: Was Ist Aufklärung?” Berlinische Monatsschrift, December 1784.4 Immanuel Kant, Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, 1799.5 Michel Foucault, What Is Enlightenment?, n.d., https://foucault.info/documents/foucault.whatIsEnlightenment.en/.All of this separation and stratification has taken place in the context of the modern research university, that entity that emerged in the 19th century as states worked to formalize the space of intellectual inquiry demanded by Enlightenment thinkers. In the readings these are represented by Immanuel Kant’s essay, “What is Enlightenment?”34 and the commentary on it by Michel Foucault.5 Without denying that the state is due the obedience of the public, Kant urges the right to freedom of argument.\nThe devastating invasions by Republican and Napoleonic France taught a stinging lesson to the still-divided German-speaking realms, and “counter-Enlightenment” reforms of society included the creation of new academic, military, and state institutions. Germany’s Humboldtian universities set out the basic contours of modern academic life: tenure, freedom of thought for professors, unity of research and teaching, and isolation from non-scholarly life.6\n6 R. D. Anderson, European Universities from the Enlightenment to 1914 (Oxford University Press, 2004), https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.001.0001.\n\n\nGeorges Cuvier (1769-1832) and works from La Regne Animal\n\n\nIn France, Enlightenment influence would be sanctified. Voltaire and Rousseau were literally exhumed and reburied at the Panthéon7 and a variety of symbolic and institutional rebirths remade the French state. In that context, both revolutionary and post-Revolutionary Napoleonic governments sought to remake the academy, along with the rest of society.\n7 Talj Gordon Tatum, Panthéonizations and Exhumations : Ceremonial Reburials in Revolutionary France., 2016, https://hdl.handle.net/2104/9800.\n\n\n\nThe Panthéon of Paris in 1795; image by Jean Baptiste Hilaire\n\n\n\nFrench natural history, with Georges Cuvier as a leading scholar, focused on systematizing knowledge of past and present lifeforms and he turned its categorizing gaze upon humans as well, proposing a three-part, hierarchical racial schema (Caucasian, Mongolian, Ethiopian) with multipe sub-branches. George Stocking lays out the broader directions of early anthropological research in France.",

Already 39% of companies require employees to use AI tools, with an additional 46% encouraging employees to use the tools without mandating that they do so.\n\n\nHowever, this new technology has not yet fully delivered on this productivity promise: Nearly half (47%) of employees using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect, and 77% say these tools have actually decreased their productivity and added to their workload.\n\n\nFor example, survey respondents reported that they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content (39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now being asked to do more work (21%).\n\nTechnology author Mayo Olshin: “If however, you simply”trust” the Al outputs due to lack of knowledge, skill, or willingness to review results, the long term damage will outweigh the initial productivity gains you got so “hyped” about.” A similar experience from David Chisnall on CoPilot: “It has cost me more time than it has saved.”",

    "title": "Conflict deaths in Bolivia, 2023–24",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Eleven people have died in social movement-related violence in Bolivia since the beginning of 2023, ten of them the victims of violence carried out by other social groups. These conflicts pitted rural community members against miners, as well as disputes within the same profession, be it mining cooperatives, urban transit drivers, or rival claimants to rural land. Only one death, in January 2023, was caused by security forces, who fired a projectile into the eye of a bystander during raucous protests over the arrest of right-wing governor Luis Fernando Camacho.\nIn addition, the government of Luis Arce attributed four deaths from medical causes to the side effects of pro-Evo Morales blockades in January 2024. (Per our codebook, we record such collateral consequences but exclude them from other analysis.)\n\nDeadly protest events, January 2023–August 2024\nThe recent events are as follows:\nCamacho arrest protests: The December 28 arrest of Santa Cruz’s governor (and ex-presidential candidate) Luis Fernando Camacho touched off immediate protests in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the regional capital. Following a one-day airport takeover, members of Camacho’s Civic Movement alternated between daytime blockades and nighttime property destruction. On New Year’s Day, police fired a projectile—likely a tear-gas canister—into the eye of Edwin Chávez Durán. The man enduring no fewer than seven surgeries over the next two weeks before succumbing to a heart attack on January 13.\nMapiri mining clash: Amid negotiations upon the filing of mining permits for a mine site located on the Merque river, confrontations began between prospective miners at the site and community members. The mining firm, Minera La Deseada, is described as Chilean, and the workers involed as arriving outsiders, some or all from Caranavi, according to the OTB of Mapiri, led by Ruddy Salcedo. Salcedo describes a Chilean business owner as present at the start of the confrontation, urging them to begin work by force. Community members occupied the disputed site, waiting for police to arrive. In the ensuing confrontation, stones, dynamite, and firearms were used, wounding ten people and killing Jhilmer Cuele Sompero. Community struggles challenging the La Deseada Mine have been ongoing for years; a 2020 mobilization shows leaders describing a five year struggle up to that point. In 2020, they were demanding the enforcement of a ruling by the national mining authority AJAM.\nLimoncito mining conflict: On March 1, police accompanied an inspection visit by AJAM to document the stone-mining operation of the Dracruz company, in Limoncito, El Torno municipality. The delegation was confronted by mine workers who launched rockets and otherwise attacked the inspectors and police. Amid a retreat, Sub-Lieutenant Ronald Choque Mamani suffered a cardio-pulmonary arrest and collapsed to the ground. (Initial reports of bullet wounds to the officer proved unfounded.) He could not be revived. Five men were taken into custody for investigation by the FELCC and prosecutors [@AutopsiaConfirmaQue2023]. Subsequent inspection on March 10 revealed an unpermitted mining operation extending over 16 hectares of municipal land. Police then took both heavy equipment and documentation from the company . Local residents had complained of the operation, and have an ongoing campaign against other illegal mining operations.\nSantagro rural land dispute: In El Puente municipality of Santa Cruz, conflict flared up between members of the Intercultural farmer federation, who established settlements there in December 2023, and the employees of the Santagro soy producing company, which works on the land. The armed confrontation on March 30 claimed the lives of two men, Francisco Morales and Jorge Pérez.\nCotoca land dispute: During a confrontation between established residents and squatters in Cotoca, Herland Salinas Añez was stabbed multiple times, first by a machete and then by a short blade knife (arma blanca) and killed. Several others suffered machete and bullet wounds during the confrontation. Witness reports describe the confrontation as continuing over several days. Police arrested 25 to 33 people, whom they investigated for the illegal land occupation. Per a more detailed report, the housing takeover was sudden and carried out by a group arriving in a van, making the squatters the attackers.\nLaji Lurizani mining conflict: Wilmer Chambi Salcedo, 25, was shot and died while in an ambulance transporting him from Apolo to La Paz. He was one of four wounded in a conflict in the Santa Rosa community in the Laja sector of Apolo on September 13, 2023. The violence resulted from a conflict between illegal miners and community members in the protected Parque Nacional y Área Natural de Manejo Integrado Madidi (PN-ANMI Madidi). On September 15, the Autoridad Jurisdiccional Administrativa Minera (AJAM) reaffirmed that no mining rights were granted anywhere in the protected area. The same day, police arrived in the conflict zone and took control of the Laji Lurizani community. Bitza Delgado, the wife of the deceased Wilmer Chambi Salcedo, demanded that the authorities move to find those responsible for his death.\nThe death marked a continued worsening of violence due to mining conflicts in the Apolo region of northern La Paz. Illegal and informal mining thrives in the region. On September 18, community members of Laji Lurizani arrived in La Paz’s Plaza Murilo to protest the activities of illegal miners and their backers, and the absence of the state. Residents testified and presented photographic evidence of how illegal miners force them under threat of violence to allow them to do what they want in the area.\nPailitas land dispute: A week of armed confrontation between interculturales and peasants disputing land rights in the Forest Reserve of the Ascensión de Guarayos province resulted in the death of the intercultural Félix Ribera Bellido (23) of San Julían and the injury of 14 others. The death occurred early on the morning of December 2, when a conflict erupted between the communities of Pailitas and Santa María (in the Los Londras area). On December 6, the leader of the interculturales of San Julían, Tito Rokas, threatened the death of landowners in the province, claiming they were responsible for the violence. President Luis Arce announced that the violence would not be tolerated and summoned an emergency meeting of ministers to analyze the land conflict and propose structural solutions. The director of the National institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA) emphasized however that the lands being fought over were in fact property of the state, as all of the properties lie withing the Gurayos Forest Reserve. The Bolivian Ombudsman’s Office condemned the violence and called upon all actors to lower the temperature and to find peaceful solutions to the conflict. On January 16, 2024, Heber Sixto Canaza Sacaca (47), one of the leaders of the San Julían syndicate, was charged with homicide, for his role in inciting the violence on December 2, and for land trafficking, due to his promise to deliver properties in the municipality to intercultural groups. He was apprehended and taken into custody on January 15 and transferred to Santa Cruz by the FELCC. Sixto Canza had also been previously involved in another armed conflict in the Las Londras area in 2021, during which a group of journalists, police, and businessmen were kidnapped and tortured.\nCochabamba transit clash: A taxi driver suffered blunt force trauma while being attacked by drivers of a rival union of drivers disputing their line. One report indicates he and his brother were dragged out of their vehicle and held in another, possibly suffering the wound when jumping out of the vehicle. A doctor described blunt trauma inflicted by a large stone.\nGuanay mining clash: Conflict among miners resulted in two injuries (both with metal shrapnel) and the trauma-induced heart attack of Mauricio Soliz Miranda.\nYani mining conflict: National Police intervened in the Yani community of Sorata municipality where two groups of cooperative miners were in open confrontation. This confrontation included injuries from firearms suffered inside the mine the night of July 25. Sent to accompany officials from AJAM and to de-escalate the conflict, the police were confronted by members of one side of the dispute. Reportedly, the miners threw rocks and dynamite at the arriving police, and set the hill on fire. Caught in the flames, two police officers suffered severe burns to 70% and 80% of their bodies respectively. One of those burned, Fabricio Reynoso Gutiérrez, succumbed to his injuries in a La Paz hospital. Altogether, four police were hospitalized. Two alleged perpetrators were arrested and held in preventative detention. One party to the dispute was the Cooperativa Minera “Señor de Mayo”, seemingly the side complaining of illegal occupation of their stake, while the other side (per a social media post circulated by Señor de Mayo) is known as Hijos de Ingenio. The latter allege further violence by Hijos de Ingenio, including a shooting on the following day.\n\n\nThe pattern of violence under President Luis Arce has shifted from past conflict\nAs we near the end of Luis Arce’s fourth year as president, it’s now clear that political violence in Bolivia has taken a new shape. The left–right conflict, which claimed 38 lives during the 2019 political crisis (most of them shot dead during grassroots protests against the newly installed Áñez government), has receded in violence. Five deaths occurred from this longstanding divide.\n\n\n\nDeaths by presidency since 2001. Click to view this chart since 1982\n\n\nPublic protest in Bolivia remains active as ever, but there has been little deadly violence between police and people protesting the government. Only two people have been killed in sociopolitical conflicts by security forces, a jailed official who died after mistreatment and a protester wounded by a less-lethal munition. Only one presidency saw less lethal violence by Bolivian security forces since 1982: Eduardo Rodríguez’s eight-month interim government. Comparable restraint was shown under the leadership of Hernán Siles Zuazo (1982–85) and Carlos Mesa (2003–05).\nInstead, it is local and inter-movement conflicts that are taking the deadliest toll: 32 deaths in four years. Additionally, all three of the deaths of state security forces came in instances where the Arce government intervened to stop violence between conflicting communities of its own supporters, in conflicts over coca union leadership in Apolo, over mining in Sorata and El Torno.\nWith the exception of two university student government-related tragedies, in Potosí and El Alto, these are competitions over land, employment, and environment. These conflicts are the dark side of a literal gold rush in northwest Bolivia and a fundamentally similar rush for rural land and space for housing on the urban periphery. Asserting collective claims to land or mining rights is not new in Bolivia, but disputes among competing groups have become increasingly violent in a handful of regions, with mining collectives, agribusiness companies, and intercultural settlers increasingly turning to firearms in clashes to defend their claims. These groups are part of large economic strata, notably cooperative miners and intercultural peasants, who participate in the grassroots coalition behind Bolivia’s governing party, complicating the government’s management of such conflicts. Meanwhile the administrative agencies, AJAM for mining and INRA for land frequently find themselves asserting that one even both sides of these conflicts have a legal right to disputed territory.\n\n\n\nDeadly events during the Arce administration by protest domain and locale\n\n\nRelative restraint by the Arce government in the use of deadly force has been a welcome change from the massacres of the interim government. The remaining question is whether the Movement Towards Socialism can adjudicate disputes over land and calm local tensions within its grassroots base.\nClick here for an interactive directory of directory of all deaths recorded in the dataset.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Violent death cast a shadow over multiple social movements in Bolivia during the third calendar year of President Luis Arce. Deliberate killings came in clashes over land, mining, and the planned census, claiming eight lives, while tear gas detonated in a student meeting led to a stampede in which five were killed. A government bureaucrat who exposed a major corruption scandal died of years of mistreatment in prison. A motorcyclist was killed by a wire strung as part of a road blockade. And a brutal stabbing killed another participant in road blockades. Altogether, fifteen Bolivians lost their lives in or around Bolivia’s often charged movement conflicts.\nThe deadly events were as follows:\n\nLa Estrella land clash, March 19: Intercultural farmers had moved on March 12 to occupy lands on the “La Estrella” ranch, owned by Jacob Ostreicher and subject to claims of money laundering in a 2011 case that attracted international attention. These land occupiers were attacked on March 19 by armed people, either farmworkers or hired attackers presumibly sponsored by in-country landowner Claudia Liliana Rodríguez. (Ostreicher remains in exile.) The attackers confronted the Intercultural squatters around 22:00, shooting rockets and firing firearms. Franklin Delgadillo, son of Intercultural leader Ricardo Delgadillo, was shot and killed. The Interculturales maintained a multiday blockade demanding justice afterwards. Police arrested at least nine people for the killing in March 2022.\nDeath of imprisoned Indigenous Fund official, April 19: Marco Antonio Aramayo, the former director of Bolivia’s Fondo Indígena, died in custody following seven years of detention under an abusive avalanche of investigations in a scandal he himself brought to light. The Fondo Indígena, which Aramayo headed from 2013 to 2015, was intended to provide independent funding to indigenous communities for development and self-representation. Aramayo denounced in 2016 that the Fund was instead used by Minister Nemesia Achacolla as a slush fund during an election year.\nWhile many have been accused of corrupt acts, Aramayo has borne the highest weight of prosecutions (over 250 investigations begun); he was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in 2017. ITEI, a Bolivian organization that supports victims of torture and state violence, issued a statement: Aramayo’s “death is the tragic conclusion of a series of violations of [his] fundamental rights,” “which affect [him] and also affect people deprived of liberty in general.” According to the ITEI, which has provided medical and psychological attention to him since 2017, police and penal authorities tortured Aramayo physically with beatings and stress positions; biologically by depriving him of food, water, or medicine; psychologically with threats, extortion, insults, and humiliation. Aramayo was repeatedly required to travel to attend new cases across the country, with the final one filed two weeks before his death. Exhausted from his ordeal, Aramayo died of multiple organ failure, aggravated by diabetes and hypertension. While police announced an investigation into his death, his legal representative denounced that no actions had been taken three weeks later.\nPotosí university stampede, May 9: A nightmarish stampede ensued at Potosí’s Tomás Frías University after a tear gas grenade was set off during an indoor meeting to convene university federation elections. Some five thousand students were reportedly in the coliseum. Many were injured in the rush to flee, including four who were killed that day and one more who died on June 15. Reportedly two of the dead were mothers who leave behind children. Six were sent to intensive care. Between 71 and 83 were wounded. The tragedy was apparently amplified by the locking of the main exit doors.\nBolivian student politics operates in close coordination with national political parities and is often highly contentious. The tragedy also put attention on student leaders who maintain student status over decades and accumulate patronage and power in on-campus political organization.Four students, at least two of them involved in student politics, have been arrested in connection with the gas release and its deadly consequences. The Minister of Justice names Manfred Flores Canaza as the “principal and material author” of the crime.\nTinguipaya clash, May 15: Two men died in fratricidal violence in the town of Tinguipaya, Potosí. The brawl between differently organized Indigenous people—ayllus vs. campesinos—followed a visit by Vice President Choquehuanca and involved stones, sticks, slingshots, and rockets. Ironically, Choquehuanca’s speech, marking the opening of a political training school, had called for cross-cultural unity and fearless speech. The cause of the conflict remains totally disputed: national MAS-IPSP official attributed it to a local land conflict, while some local figures and opposition politicians blamed internal partisan disputes within the MAS-IPSP linked to the local mayor. Police attempting to investigate the incident had difficulty entering the area in the following days.\nChiñijo land clash, June 23: On June 23 a confrontation over land ownership in the community of Tamiplaya Tolapampa in Chiñijo, Sorata resulted in the beating deaths of two local campesinos and injury to an additional five. A group of 60 land-grabbers, hired and led by Gabriel Callisaya Toledo, Mario Luque, and Genaro Quito attacked the community in attempt to take their land, intimidating them with dynamite, dogs, and firearms. The General Secretary of Chiñijo, Susana Silva, claimed that Sorata police refused to provide assistance or to remove the bodies of the victims and only arrived at the on the 26th. Communities members protested by taking the victims’ bodies to Sorata in a protest march in order to demand justice. The community members possessed a resolution from the National Institue of Agrarian Reform (INRA) that recognized their right to the property and instructed the police to forcefully evict unlawful occupants.\nMapiri mining cooperatives clash, June 24: A group of expelled members of the Hijos de Pueblo gold mining cooperative attacked the cooperative in the community of Charobamba, Mapiri, in an attempt to regain leadership. A local teacher, Faustino Nestor Maqui Chambi, was killed when he was hit in the head by a stone, causing him to fall from his boat and drown. Police arrested 7 or 8 of the agressors, but their convoy was attacked in Aguada while transporting the arrested persons to La Paz and one the arrestees escaped.\nSanta Cruz census strike, deaths on October 22, November 9 and 10: The Santa Cruz Civic Movement mounted a 36-day department-wide strike in protest of the delay of the Census to 2024, and demanding it be held in 2023. Clash between supporters of Santa Cruz general strike and those attempting to open blockades. During an October 22 clash on the Amistad bridge that connects Santa Cruz with Brazil, a municipal employee of Arroyo Concepción, Julio Pablo Taborga, suffered injuries from blows to his head. He was transported to a hospital in Puerto Quijarro where his death was recorded early the next morning. According to Taborga’s wife, he was demonstrating against the blockade when supporters of the strike arrived with dynamite and homemade bombs and began to beat him. Video of the confrontation appeared to show victim succumbing to tear gas rather than a beating. The Santa Cruz Civic Committee released a statement blaming the MAS for the conflict.\nEduardo Arancibia Barrancos was killed in the early morning of November 9 while driving a motorcycle to work. He attempted to drive through a blockade point in the Tres Lagunas neigborhood of Santa Cruz. He did not notice that a coaxial cable was stretched across the road between two poles. This cable cut through his upper neck as he drove, causing his death. Police arested five men who were maintaining the blockade point.\nOvernight on November 11, a group of four or five people attacked two men who were maintaining a blockade in the Barrio Latino of the Los Lotes zone of Santa Cruz. The attackers assaulted Jairo Montero, 21, and José Eduardo Sosa, 28, with knives, leaving Montero hospitalized with criticall injuries and Eduardo Sosa dead. The Sosa’s heart was reportedly cut out of his chest by the attackers. Two of the attackers were arrested on November 15.\n\n\n\n\nTable of deaths in 2023\n\n\n\nTrends in protest deaths\nThe death in custody of Marco Antonio Aramayo marks the first social-movement-related death at the hands of the state under the presidency of Luis Arce. Otherwise, responsibility for these deaths rests among civilians and generally within social movements themselves, though the motives of the assault on José Eduardo Sosa need to be clarified. While international attention tends to focus on left-right partisan conflict in Bolivia, local conflicts over rural land (three to five deaths), mining (one death in Mapiri), or political affiliation made up the bulk of deaths in 2022.\nDeadly state violence against protesters, the modal situation in four decades of recorded death in the database, remains at a standstill. No security forces have killed a Bolivian protester since the Senkata massacre on November 19, 2019, and MAS-IPSP governments last saw a state-perpetrated killing in August 2018. Over the last four decades, state-perpetrated violence occurred more than six times as often under right wing governments as under left-wing ones (13.0 vs 2.1 deaths per year). Conversely, violence among civilians is 38% more frequent during left governments (5.64 vs 4.08 deaths per year).\nAs can be seen in the list above, investigation of the prepetrators of political violence was uneven, with the Tinguipaya clashes and the Aramayo death in custody possibly becoming the latest examples of impunity for violence. The extraordinary systemic delays in the Bolivian justice system make it likely that accountability for political violence in 2022 could take years to come through the judicial system.",

    "text": "Welcome\nThis research notes website is an experiment born of crisis and grief. Expect it to change forms before it settles.\nIt’s a space where I will witness planned cruelty and human tragedies with numbers and data. Because my primary research project archives the death of nearly seven hundred Bolivians who lost their lives in political struggle and I need somewhere to reflect on what that means.\nBecause weapons sent by my country’s government are inflicting quantitatively far greater losses weekly and we need data to make sense of how.\nBecause using numbers and maps and wrapping my head around the scale of things can dramatically change how I view the world. And I can share those perspectives through data.\nBecause carefully presented evidence offers a path through the public denial that keeeps power intact.\nAnd because these are the tools I’ve been training myself to use, and they won’t fit on my other main spaces for public reflection, including my blog: Carwil without Borders.\nLastly behind this data, there is a lot of death.

    "text": "Carwil Bjork-James is the principal investigator of Ultimate Consequences, a digital archive on death in Bolivian political conflict and the author of The Sovereign Street: Making Revolution in Urban Bolivia.. He is a cultural anthropologist who conducts immersive and historical research on disruptive protest, environmental struggles, state violence, and indigenous collective rights. He is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and of Law at Vanderbilt University.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, Prof. Bjork-James conducted ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews on social movements, race and space, protest tactics, and political change in Cochabamba, Sucre, and La Paz, resulting in a monograph, The Sovereign Street, and articles including \"Binding Leaders to the Community\" (Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 2018), \"Race and the Right to Speak for the City: Political Violence in Bolivia's 2006–2009 Stalemate\" (UAS, 2019), \"Unarmed Militancy\" (American Anthropologist, 2020). Using both anthropological and historical methods, The Sovereign Street explores how pivotal public events generate political legitimacy, contribute to major (sometimes revolutionary) transformations in the balance of power, and provide models for future political action. The ethnographic evidence collected about these events—of social life as experienced through the human body, the meanings attached to places, and social movement practices—explains how grassroots movements exert leverage upon the state through protest.\nUltimate Consequences is supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and a Digital Humanities Incubation Grant from Vanderbilt University. Drawing on the database, Prof. Bjork-James wrote an expert witness report for the plaintiffs in Mamani et al. v. Sánchez de Lozada et al., the first US Federal case to hold a head of state liable for human rights violations, and the white paper \"Mass Protest and State Repression in Bolivian Political Culture\" (Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, 2020). His published scholarship has also addressed the evolving international human rights regime, social movement interventions into global governance, anti-indigenous racism and state violence in eastern Colombia, and socio-environmental conflicts and state environmental policy in the Andes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "“Anthropology, as it was practiced throughout much of the 19th century,” writes Rachel Caspari, “was a single biocultural discipline, with race linking the components.”1 Even though the nineteenth century saw a tremendous intellectual revolution in human biology—the introduction of a formal understanding of evolution—the foundational role of race remained unshaken, even reinforced, by this change.\n1 Rachel Caspari, “From Types to Populations: A Century of Race, Physical Anthropology, and the American Anthropological Association,” American Anthropologist 105, no. 1 (2003): 65–76.This week’s readings center three forms of evolutionary thinking in nineteenth century anthropology, which were tied together in the minds of their advocates: cultural evolution through stages of savagery, barbarism, and civilization; biological evolution of species (and it was presumed, races); and “social Darwinism” to describe the relative success of nations and classes.\nStefanos Gerlounas describes the nineteenth century as a time of three-stage theories of human pre/history, embraced across the century by Comte, Spencer, Tylor, Morgan, Marx, Engels, and Frazer. Lewis Henry Morgan’s Ancient Society2 and Edward Burnett Tylor’s Primitive Culture3 both make the same intellectual move, situating contemporary “savage” cultures as living fossils of a prior “primitive” era in human history, through which “barbarian” and “civilized’ peoples had already passed:\n2 Lewis H Morgan, Ancient Society, or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization (Charles H Kerr And Company, 1877), http://archive.org/details/ancientsociety035004mbp.3 Edward Burnett Tylor, Primitive culture: Researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom (Murray, 1920), http://archive.org/details/primitiveculture01tylouoft.\nThe thesis which I venture to sustain, within limits, is simply this, that the savage state in some measure represents an early condition of mankind, out of which the! higher culture has gradually been developed or evolved, by processes still in regular operation as of old, the result showing that, on the whole, progress has far prevailed over! relapse. (Tylor, p. 32)\nThe remote ancestors of the Aryan nations presumptively passed through an experience similar to that of existing barbarous and savage tribes. Though the experience of these nations embodies all the information necessary to illustrate the periods of civilization, both ancient and modern. (Morgan)\n\nEnglish professor Patrick Brantlinger is concerned with the rhetoric of extinction attached to Indigenous peoples worldwide by European writers, scientific and otherwise. These discourses were both certain of the impending extinction of savage peoples, and if trouble by it, only troubled from a scientific point of view. Brantlinger argues that these views were generally dismissive:\n\nWith a few exceptions—Lewis Henry Morgan and Alfred Russel Wallace are perhaps the main ones—most evolutionists treat primitive races and cultures negatively, not only as doomed by the inexorable laws of nature but also as meriting their pending extinctions. (165)\n\nDark Vanishings incorporates a wide range of nineteenth century anthropologists including: Thomas Jefferson (Notes on the State of Virginia, 1787); Albert Gallatin (Synopsis of the Indian Tribes of North America, 1836; founder of the American Ethnological Society, 1842) Henry Schoolcraft (The American Indians, Their History, Condition and Prospects); Samuel Morton (Crania Americana, 1839); Lewis Henry Morgan (League of the Iroquois, 1854); Josiah Nott and George Glidden (Types of Mankind, 1854),\nWe find in Brantlinger a surprising combination of salvage ethnography and celebration of savage demise. While making the case for “keep[ing] some scientific record of that which we destroy”, Pitt-Rivers sees no place for actual native peoples in the future other than in chains: “the savage is morally and mentally an unfit instrument for the spread of civilization, except when, like the higher mammal, he is reduced to slavery; his occupation is gone, and his place is required for an improved race.”\n\nFor broader views of American anthropology during this period, consider the earliest chapter in Lee Baker’s From Savage to Negro;4 Glynn Custred in A History of Anthropology As a Holistic Science;5 and many segments of David Hurst Thomas’ Skull Wars.6\n4 Lee D Baker, From Savage to Negro: Anthropology and the Construction of Race, 1896-1954 (University of California Press, 1998).5 Glynn Custred, Anthropology in the Nineteenth Century (Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2017).6 David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity (Basic Books, 2002).\n\n\n\nMutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution in its 2021 “Illuminated” edition\n\n\n7 Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man (Archives at NCBS, 1901), http://archive.org/details/ncbs.BB-001_0_0_0_1.\nDarwin, whose 1859 On the Origin of Species laid out the overall case for biological evolution, delayed direct consideration of the relationship of human to other animals for The Descent of Man, published in 1871.7 While Darwin presumes significant differences among “the races of man” and devotes a chapter to the topic, the text presumes a common human ancestor to all these racial groups and argues forcefully for the species’ overall closeness with primates in particular and animals in general. Nonetheless, racial groups and racial stereotypes are part of the evidentiary landscape used throughout.\nDarwin gives priority to organisms’ struggle for survival under conditions of scarcity (the primary form of natural selection in Origin), and secondary consideration to differential rates of reproduction as determined by competition for mates (theorized in Descent). Less considered by Darwin are competitions among groups and species themselves, which would more readily include tendencies towards communication, cooperation, and (a certain form of) altruism.\nThe first, more competitive form of natural selection became the basis for so-called social Darwinism, framed as “survival of the fittest” and associated with sociologist Herbert Spencer as well as founding eugenicist Francis Galton.\nA radically distinct view of natural behavior is presented by Pyotr (“Peter”) Kropotkin in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. Kropotkin highlights a wide variety of examples of cooperative behavior among animals (and plants), as well as human at each level of the social evolutionary ladder. While the subject of much skepticism initially, Kropotkin’s overall ideas overlap with Darwin’s, and mutualism within species is taken seriously as a factor in interspecies competition and macroevolution by current biologists.\nStephen Jay Gould (2000:471) even argues that Kropotkin and Darwin’s different emphases stem from their research environments: “In fact, Kropotkin, who was well trained in biology, spoke for a Russian consensus in arguing that density-independent regulation by occasional, but severe, environmental stress will tend to encourage intraspecific cooperation as a mode of natural selection. The harsh environments of the vast Russian steppes and tundras often elicited such a generalized belief; Kropotkin and colleagues had observed well in a local context, but had erred in over generalization. But Darwin and Wallace, schooled in the … tropics, may have made an equally parochial error in advocating such a dominant role for biotic struggle over limited resources in crowded space.”8\n8 Stephen Jay Gould, The structure of evolutionary theory (Belknap Press, 2002).9 Gould, The structure of evolutionary theory.10 Michael Tomasello, Why We Cooperate, A Boston Review Book (The MIT Press, 2009), https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=88bf887e-e045-30b0-a60f-4a9cca13578a.11 David Sloan Wilson, Does Altruism Exist? : Culture, Genes, and the Welfare of Others, Foundational Questions in Science (Yale University Press, 2014), https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ff9db0f7-14f2-3c57-bb76-19f6ba1dcd7f.For recent summaries of speciesslevel cooperation and mutualism, see paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould’s chapter on “Species as Individuals in the Hierachical Theory of Selection”9; primatologist Michael Tomasello’s Why We Cooperate;10 and David Sloan Wilson’s Does Altruism Exist?.11",

    "text": "Franz Boas and Paul Rivet, two long-distance friends and foundational colleagues in their discipline,1 each published major works around the same time that analyzed thousands of skulls using conventional anthropometric techniques. But these works, published on opposite sides of the Atlantic each upended long-held assumptions about racial types and the heritability of physical traits.\n1 Christine Laurière, “Anthropology and Politics, the Beginnings: The Relations between Franz Boas and Paul Rivet (1919-42),” Histories of anthropology annual 6, no. 1 (2010): 225252, https://doi.org/10.1353/haa.2010.0004.Boas’s 1912 article “Changes in Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants” analyzed the cranial measurements of around 18,000 children and young adults and found that the then-accepted measure of cranial form — the cephalic index — varied significantly between American immigrants and first-generation children of American immigrants, and also between families with different numbers of children:\n\nAmerican-born descendants of immigrants differ in type from their foreign-born parents. The changes which occur among various European types are not all in the same direction. They develop in early childhood and persist throughout life. … Foreign-born parents when compared with their own foreign- born and American-born children exhibit the same types of differences for the children as the whole series.2\n2 Franz Boas, “Changes in the Bodily Form of Descendants of Immigrants,” American Anthropologist 14, no. 3 (1912): 530–62, https://doi.org/10.1525/aa.1912.14.3.02a00080.\n\n\n\nBoas’ description of his sample population, stratified by ethnicity and age\n\n\nRivet’s 1909-10 study, released in a serial fashion in the journal L’Anthropologie (1909|1910), analyzed the cranial measurements of over 6,000 individuals from around the world, including a substantial number of non-human primates. In this case the variable in question was prognathism, defined as “the protrusion of the upper or lower jaw … [measured as] the facial angle (the slope of a line from forehead to jaw).”3\n3 Alice L. Conklin, In the Museum of Man: Race, Anthropology, and Empire in France, 18501950 (Cornell University Press, 2013), 63, https://doi.org/10.7591/9780801469046.\nII suffit de parcourir ce tableau, pour constater qu’il n’y a qu’un rapport trés lointain entre l’ordre dans lequel s’y inscrivent les diverses populations et celui qu’on aurait obtenuen les classant d’aprés leur degré d’évolution intellectuelle ou matérielle. Certes, dune fagon trés générale, les races blanches se rangent parmi les plus orthognathes et les races noires et rouges parmi les plus prognathes, mais les exceptions abondent.\nOne need only glance at this table to see that there is only a very distant relationship between the order in which the various populations are listed and the order that would have been obtained by classifying them according to their degree of intellectual or material evolution. Admittedly, in very general terms, white races are among the most orthognathic and black and red races among the most prognathic, but there are many exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in the same article, Rivet explicitly rejects the idea that prognathism is a marker of racial inferiority:\n\nPar contre, j’espére avoir prouvé qu’il ne faut pas lui attribuer Vimportance qu’on a été tenté parfois de lui donner en tant que caractere sériaire et qu’on ne doit surtout pas le considérer comme un caractére d’infériorité.\nOn the other hand, I hope I have demonstrated that we should not attribute to it the importance that we have sometimes been tempted to give it as a serious character trait, and that we should certainly not consider it a sign of inferiority.\n\nBoas and Rivet were two of the early twentieth century scientists who were “wrestling with many of the … methodological and conceptual problems in race science.”4 As we’ve seen in class, some scientists would react to the lack of supportive evidence for profound racial difference, much less racial inferiority, with disbelief, and others with steady confidence that the necessary data were forthcoming.\n4 Conklin, In the Museum of Man, 64.5 Manifesto by 1,284 Noted u.s. Scientists Denounces Racialism, Fascist Position on Science, n.d., https://www.jta.org/archive/manifesto-by-1284-noted-u-s-scientists-denounces-racialism-fascist-position-on-science.Boas and Rivet were two scholars who eventually concluded that the evidence was lacking for racial difference and turned their eye towards racism as both an object of study and political target. Ultimately, Boas would organize 1,284 scientists from 167 universities to sign a joint manifesto in December 1938 to, in his words, “declare that we scientists have the moral obligation to educate the American people against all false and unscientific doctrines, such as the racial nonsense of the Nazis.”5\nCraniometry’s collapse as a racial measure is documented in Paul Turbull’s recent chapter “Surveying Craniometry.”6 Boas’ engagement with race is the subject of a chapter of Lee Baker’s From Savage to Negro.7 Rivet’s studies of craniometry are described in Christine Laurière’s biography of Rivet.8\n6 Paul Turnbull, Surveying Craniometry (Routledge, 2023).7 Lee D Baker, From Savage to Negro: Anthropology and the Construction of Race, 1896-1954 (University of California Press, 1998).8 Christine Laurière, Se faire un nom, Archives (Publications scientifiques du Muséum, 2008), 167–209, https://books.openedition.org/mnhn/2401.9 Bronwen Douglas, Climate to Crania:: Science and the Racialization of Human Difference, ed.
