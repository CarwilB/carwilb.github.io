    "text": "Bookdown to Quarto\nConverting a Bookdown book to Quarto is slightly more involved than converting a website. A book has chapters whose order must be defined, and likely has citations and cross-refs. Still, conversion is not that hard.\nWe got some practice converting from Bookdown to Quarto by helping Gavin Fay convert his lab’s fantastic onboarding documentation, the Faylab Lab Manual. Here’s the GitHub view before and after.\nOur best first reference material for this was Nick Tierney’s Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto. Nick shares some scripts in that post to automate some changes. In our case, the book was small enough that we made all changes manually. Quarto documentation was indispensable.\n\nExperimenting in a low-risk environment\nWe forked a copy of the Faylab Lab manual to the Openscapes organization, and worked in a branch so we could make changes relatively risk-free. We could always fork a new copy of the original if we “broke” something. (Caution: the default when making a pull request from a fork is to push changes to the original upstream repo, not your fork and it does this without warning if you have write-access to that repo.) With local previews it’s easy to test / play with settings to see what they do. We tended to make a change, Preview, then compare the look and functionality of the book to the original. It was helpful to comment out some elements of the configuration file _output.yml after their counterparts had been added to the Quarto configuration file _quarto.yml, or to confirm they were no longer needed, before making the drastic move of deleting them.\n\n\nThe conversion\nHere are the main steps to convert the Faylab Lab manual from Bookdown to Quarto.\nCreate new empty file called _quarto.yml and add book metadata there. The screenshots below\nSet project type as book.\nMove metadata out of index.qmd and into _quarto.yml. Title, author, and publication date were in index.qmd with date set using date: \"Last updated:r Sys.Date()\". Now these are in _quarto.yml with date set using date: last-modified. Note that having R code would require you to adjust code chunk options in the Quarto style (#|). This tripped us up a bit; see GitHub Actions.\nMove chapters listing out of _bookdown.yml and into _quarto.yml.\nAdd page footer to _quarto.yml.\nHere’s what ours looked like when we finished the steps above (_quarto.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaylab Lab Manual\n\n\n\n\n\nChange insertion of images from html style to Quarto style. (Note Quarto calls them “figures”, not “images”.) The following snippet will insert the GitHub octocat logo in a page:\n![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"35px\"}\nChange all filename extensions .Rmd -&gt; .qmd (you could Preview after this change and see that the book looks the same). Note that Quarto works with .Rmd files just as well as it does .qmd, so this change is not urgent. In fact, if you have a lot of R code in your .Rmds (unlike the Faylab Lab Manual), there will be additional tinkering needed to make the code chunks happy.\n\n\nCitations\nThe Faylab Lab Manual cited two papers, presenting us with an opportunity to see how easy it is to add references to a Quarto book. Briefly, in the Visual Editor, Insert &gt; Citation &gt; DOI. Pasting the DOI or its full URL, we can insert the citation. This automatically creates a references.bib file and adds the full citations at the bottom of the chapter page (watch demo). In July 2022, we had to manually add a ## References heading, but this may not be necessary in future Quarto updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert citation via its DOI using RStudio Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing notes\nIf the book’s output is strictly html, there’s no need to specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _book/, which is what we’d like. If we wanted other types of output like like PDF or EPUB, etc. those single file outputs are also written to the output-dir (Quarto docs).\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder, delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _book/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_book/\nOnce all is settled, delete _output.yml.\nOnce the Openscapes fork was fully reviewed, we made a pull request from that to the main branch of the book’s repo. Once that was merged, we set up GitHub Actions to render the book. (TODO: instructions for GitHub Actions)\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nThis book was mostly prose and screenshots without any R code. This made the conversion from RMarkdown to Quarto likely more straightforward than if you also needed to adjust code chunk options in the quarto style (#|). Our initial GitHub Action to render the converted Faylab Lab Manual failed because we had a piece of R code - even though the code was commented out! This was resolved when we deleted the line."

    "text": "Distill to quarto\nWe transitioned our events site from distill to quarto in May 2022 (github view before and after). We followed excellent notes and examples from Nick Tierney and Danielle Navarro.\nAfter we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed “Build website” rather then “Render Website” and “Preview Website”, and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the .Rproj file. Clicking on the .Rproj file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options &gt; Build Tools &gt; Project Build Tools &gt; None.\nLooking at files /posts/_metadata.yml and _quarto.yml helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added citation: true to /posts/_metadata.yml and in _quarto.yml under the website key we set site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events. We deleted footer.html used with distill because footer is now defined in quarto.yml.\n\nPublishing notes\n\nBackground: Our distill site had been set up to output to a docs folder, and had GitHub Settings &gt; Pages set to look there rather gh-pages branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We’ve inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in _quarto.yml: output-dir: docs. However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -\n\nDon’t specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _site/, which is what we’d like.\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _site/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_site/\nPush these changes, merge into main.\nOn GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing\nFollow instructions from the explore and setup chapter."

And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more “guardrails”: accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love RMarkdown, and it’s for people who have never used RMarkdown.\nThe ability for Quarto to streamline collaboration has been so cool and important for our NASA Openscapes project. Quarto has been a common place for us to collaborate - across R and Python languages and coding expertise."

You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache."

This takes about 20 minutes. (For an even more detailed walk-through, see Allison Horst’s ESM 206 Google Doc).\n\n\nClone your repo\nYou’ll start by cloning your repository into RStudio.\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git &gt; paste your repository name.\nR for Excel Users: Clone your repository using RStudio has detailed instructions and screenshots of these steps.\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nNext, you’ll install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. After downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer. When it is complete, you won’t see an application or any new software, but it is now available to RStudio (as well as all other applications on your computer, including the command line).\n\n\nRStudio orientation\nNow let’s take a moment to get oriented. This is an RStudio project, which is indicated in the top-right. The bottom right pane shows all the files in your project; everything we’ve cloned from GitHub. We can open any RStudio project by opening its .Rproj file, or from RStudio File &gt; Open Project ….\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the project name and files pane\n\n\n\n\nVisual Editor\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\nHere’s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Source Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready have some content formatted in a Google Doc? You can copy-paste it into the Visual Editor and most formatting will be retained.\nThe editing bar provides familiar point and click access to text formatting options like bulleted or numbered lists.\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the point and click editing bar\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe Visual Editor also lets you use many keyboard shortcuts that might be familiar for adding boldface (command-b), italics (command-i), or headers. On a Mac, option-command-2 will make a level 2 header. Try it with option-command-1, or option-command-0 for normal text!\n\n\nInsert an image or figure\nTo insert an image (called a figure in Quarto), click the image icon. This brings up a window in which we can select the image, set its alignment, give it a caption and alt text, hyperlink it, or edit other metadata.\n\n\n\nInsert image or figure using the Visual Editor\n\n\nOnce an image is added, clicking on that image gives us editing options. We can resize it dynamically by clicking in the image and dragging a corner or side to resize. When an image is selected, its dimensions are displayed for editing. Clicking on the gray ellipsis to the right of the dimensions opens the pop-up window to access more metadata edits.\n\n\nInsert a table\nSimilar to adding an image, to insert a table, we click the Table dropdown."

    "text": "An initial spreadsheet of when, who, where, how, responsible party, in order of left to right in spreadsheet\n\n\nThe database treats events as a fundamental unit. Event is a term with many definitions in the study of social movements and contentious politics from the pivotal historical moment to the action at a single time and place as recorded by news media, but the meaning used in the database is perhaps best captured by Charles Tilly’s term episodes: ”bounded sequences of continuous interaction.” Bolivian mass mobilisation is organized in a routine sequence — collective organisation, mass mobilisation, escalation of tactics, negotiation, and concessions — and organizers work to propel the process forward repeatedly until the target, usually the government, gives in. Repressive force seeks to interrupt this process, usually by punishing movements in the mobilisation or escalation stages. For purposes of the database, we treat a relatively continuous series of actions as a single episode or event, unless and until it is interrupted by demobilisation.\n\n\n\nevent_title: Provides location and general theme of event\n\nEvent titles are brief, unique textual identifiers that should readily bring to mind the event (especially if the reader has heard of it before), and inform us as to what makes it distinctive. Therefore, unlike other elements of this codebook, there is rarely a single right answer. Also, we should be working to make these titles distinct, so when there are a lot of parallel events, we will need to be more specific.\nUse well-known names for events, if possible.\nThe event_title should state the scope of the conflict; name a locality or workplace if the conflict (or the notable deadly violence) is local. If the conflict is widespread, it should more often name the movement involved. It should name the social movement sector involved if relevant.\nIt should not name the form of violence unless it is unusual.\nUnique means that each event_title is distinct from all others in the dataset. Where needed add the year at the end of the event_title, then month or month pair. For example “Gas War 2003”, “CSUTCB mobilization April 2000.”\nThe variables, and this document are segmented into sections, each of which comprise several variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nmonth\nday: Date of the incident that caused death\n\nInteger values. Four-digit years, months from 1 to 12, days from 1 to 31.\n\n\n\n\nDayLater: later_year, later_month, later_day: Date of death, if the person died after the incident due to its consequences.\n\nOccasionally, we have an indeterminate date. Code these with the known information: October 2003 as 2003|10|[blank]. Use “or”, as in October 5 or 6 or 7, 2006 as 2006|10|5 or 6.\nHandling in R: Currently, our coding takes the first number in a textual date, retains the whole text as a note about the year, month, or day. Blank dates are automatically turned into a note reading “Unknown year” etc.\nIn the narrative: State the time if available.\nFuture options: Integrate with temporal sequence of the larger conflict (i.e., chronology of conflict could be an extended text field or link to other material)\n\n\n\n\nNote that we may choose to apply the term “victim” to deliberate deaths, according to whatever categories we choose, but the generic category in the dataset is “deceased.”\n\n\n\ndec_firstname All first and middle names\ndec_surnames: All surnames, including patronymic and matronymic surnames.\n\nDo not use ? to indicate uncertainty. Use parentheses () or slashes / instead.\nIf more than one name is found in the box:\n\nFirstName (other FirstName)- implies we think the victim’s name is the name outside of the parentheses, but a report may have indicated an alternate name\nFirstName / FirstName -implies that we have no idea which of the two is correct\nIf there are slashes in both first name and surname, they should be read as paired. A / B ; C / D, means the name is either A B or C D.\nFor last name use one of the following: PatronymicSurname MatronymicSurname\n\nPSurname (PSurname alt) MSurname\nPSurname MSurname (PSurname MSurname both alt)\nPSurname MSurname (MSurname alt)\nSingularSurname (SingularSurname alt)\n\n\nFor now, include names used in sources that are plausible misspellings among these alternative names (e.g., Miguel | Northfuster (Northdufter) Kerer). Likewise the multiple names for someone who has not been positively identified: Juan Carlos / Corado / Corado / NN | Ventura / Vilca / Veizaga / Fernández / Bejarano.\nWhen we have explicit reporting that a name was wrong, put the correct name in the name field and describe the misidentification in Complications: Gustavo | Cartagena Trujillo | Victim initially misidentified as “Edgar Vidal Rocha.”\n\n\n\n\nid_indiv — A unique identifier for each individual in the dataset that allows for cross referencing as the dataset evolves.\n\nWe want to be able to track changes in knowledge about individuals, for all fields including their names, so we assign each individual a unique identifier. This means that if their name changes, we change their inclusion status in the database (because, for example, we determine their death was accidental, or were misreported as dead), regroup them with different events, or determine that they are in fact a duplicate of another person, we can link that individual across different versions of the dataset.\nUnique IDs will also be assigned to individuals in the “Excluded from current analysis” tab once that tab is refactored to include all existing variables.\nIndividual ID (id_indiv) will take the form of the lowercase letter i followed by five numerical digits. - i — is for individual (a conveniently bilingual first letter) - First two digits assigned by year and allowing the research team to keep the unique ID’s roughly chronological without generating confusion among uninformed researchers. - - 01 Indicates an unknown year - - 02 corresponds to 1982; 10 corresponds to 1990; 20 to 2000; 30 to 2010; 40 to 2020. So, deaths in 2019 would typically begin i39 - Last three digits are assigned sequentially in rough chronological order, beginnig with 001. - - Where multiple events are occurring simultaneously, we will try to number sequentially within the events first. - - Every line in the dataset gets an individual ID, including unconfirmed = TRUE, intentionality = Nonconflict accident, etc.\n\n\n\n\ndec_age: reported age\ndec_alt_age: alternatively reported ages\n\nExpressed as an integer. Unless under two years, then we may also have a fraction in twelths.\nData entry for months: Type: &lt;equals&gt; &lt;number of months&gt; &lt;division slash&gt; 12.\nSo six months: “=6/12.”\n\ndec_gender: gender\n\nOptions: M, F, text explanation\n\ndec_ethnicity: ethnicity\n\nOptions: Mestizo/Creole, Afro-Bolivian, or indigenous group name like Quechua, Aymara, Yuracaré.\n\nFor indigenous groups, use names as listed first in the following table. Use accents. Hyphenate if a mix of the above, and join alphabetically: Aymara-Guaraní.\nFor immigrant ethnicities use Adjective-Bolivian: Palestinian-Bolivian.\nForeign ethnicities of non-citizens: Adjective. Multiples: Adjective/Adjective.\n\nIf there are two or more ethnicities coinciding: hyphens (or slashes for foreigners)\nIf we are not sure which of two ethnicities we use “or”\nIf any uncertainty, leave blank until more information is found.\n\n\nImage of contemporary groups provided by Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndec_residence: Indicates place of residence, not origin\n\nProvide the most specific location as is know. For example, if community is known, provide community. If it is not known “Municipality” is fine; “Municipality, Department” where ambiguous. “Department” where that’s all we know.\nIf there’s a longer story (e.g., a Huanuni miner of El Alto origin), list their current long-term residence (Huanuni, Oruro) in this field and add to the notes.\n\ndec_nationality: nationality\n\nProper noun of the country in English, not an adjective: Bolivia, Peru, United States, etc. Reported dual nationals get slashes: France/Bolivia.\n\n\n\n\nTo Do: specifically we need to make sure cocaleros and campesinos are coded correctly and check to see if anyone needs to be coded as private security.\n\ndec_affiliation, dec_spec_affiliation: categorical and specific affiliation\n\ndec_affiliation is a broad sectoral group. It uses the same categories as for perp_affiliation\nUse one of the following\n\nCocalero\nCampesino (includes CSUTCB, CONAMAQ, CSCIB)\nLowland Indigenous (not Quechua, Uru, or Aymara, even if members of these groups are living in the lowlands)\nHighland Indigenous (only Layme, Qaqachaka, Jukumani, and related communities involved in the Oruro–Potosí boundary disputes and Guerra de los Ayllus)\nMiner\nFactory Worker\nTransport Worker — includes taxi and trufi drivers, bus drivers, cargo truck drivers, and railworkers.\nTeacher —The Magisterio and the Normalistas (“teachers” in training from this perspective)\nLandowner — a class designation to be used when relevant, e.g., for the San Julián blockade\nUrban Movement (not more specifically identiifed above)\nPartisan, a non-officeholding militant or agent of a political party\nStudent: Engaged in collective student protest (as a student). Protesting students in larger movements should be folded in to categories above. If not protesting but are a bystander can note student in specific affiliation category\nJournalist\nCivilian (implies non-protester)\nProtester (if not identifiable by one of the above categories)\nSecurity Force: Someone employed by the State, either as a police officer or within the military\nPrivate Security: Security personnel employed privately, not by the State (new and not yet recoded)\nGovernment Officeholder\nGovernment Employee (i.e., not in security forces or in an elected role)\nArmed Actor (member of organized armed groups, including generally politically left “guerrilla,” generally politically right “paramilitary” groups, and extra official perpetrators of violence “sicarios”)\nNarcotrafficker: Individual involved in drug trade\n\nWe want to be able to ascertain whether any person is security forces (Security Force, Private Security), someone else in an organized armed organization (Armed Actor), or state civilian official (Government Officeholder, Government Employee) or a [non-state] civilian. Analysis on this nt should be possible using this variable, grouping some categories together.\n\ndec_spec_affiliation: The name of the specific organization/party/branch of security etc. The more exact or specified affiliation emerging from the victim’s overarching affliation\ndec_title: title or occupation: Refers to their title within the organization they are affiliated with. Such as rank in military or congressional position.\n\nIf they are an officer within a union and the union is acting in the conflict, this is their title within the union: “Director of Conflicts,” “Vice President”. Otherwise, indicate their title at work: factory foreman. If they die as workers not engaged in collective action (e.g., victims of the fire in the El Alto municipal building), do not seek out a movement affiliation, use their job title as best you can describe it, or simply state “municipal employee.”\nIf they are a civilian or protester, use this field to state their occupation if known.\n\n\n\nNote: The following descriptions apply to the multiple variables that assess whether a condition is true. Currently that includes: victim_armed, weapon, denial, pol_assassination, state_perpetrator.\nThe options are as follows:\n\nYes - sources confirm to be true.\nNo - sources confirm to be false\nPresumed Yes / Presumed No – A conclusion that we draw about the variable based on other facts of the case, in a systematic way. For example, for victim_armed, presumed yes/no *indicates that the victim falls into a category which would predispose them to having or not having a weapon even if such was not indicated.\nLikely Yes / Likely No – Indicates that the researcher is making a judgment based on the source information provided. Explanations of these judgment calls should be written in parentheses (if brief), or into the narrative for the event.\nDisputed – Indicates that various sources state or imply opposite conclusions and we as researchers don’t have strong enough information to judge.\n\nIf there is simply insufficient information to know the answer, leave the box blank.\n\nUncertain has been deprecated and should be removed from the database.\n\n\n\n\nVariables included in this category: cause_death, cause_medical, live_ammunition, victim_armed, weapon, denial, pol_assassination, state_perpetrator﻿\nNote: This is the first place where we may maintain a default set of exclusions from further analysis\n\n\n\ncause_death: brief, nominal description of what (usually external) act caused the death/death causing injury: The goal is to describe the external act that happened- what was enacted on the person. For example- if a person died in a fire the cause of death would be the building burning. The Medical cause of death would be burns.\n\nIf coinciding factors resulted in a death, a comma is used to symbolize plurality. Ex. (gunshot, impact)= (gunshot and impact).\nIf reports consistently note two different causes of death and the exact cause is not known a slash is used to denote OR. Ex. (gunshot/beating)= (gunshot or beating).\nBlank spaces indicate that cause of death is unknown.\nCauses of death include the following. This list is not exhaustive; other categories not listed below, but included in the database are self-explanatory.\n\nInduced health crisis: (induced via social circumstances including extra stress due to protest conditions or previous accident or injury sustained in a political event)\nIllness: An illness that occured during but not as a result of political events\nLack of necessary care: (lack of needed care due to difficulty reaching care and/or external forces preventing care. If the person was injured and then prevented from reaching necessary care, the injury is listed first in cause of death and more specific circumstances are detailed in the notes).\nGunshot: Fatal wound incurred from a gun (live ammunition)\nImpact: hit with an object thrown or projected at them during protest (rocks, stones, tear gas canister). Not from a gun or interpersonal beating.\nAssault: signifies an attack that can include both a beating and weapons such as knifes and machetes\nBeating: No weapons were used, violent interpersonal force\nVehicle: Incident involving a vehicle. Specifics of death are noted in parentheses, ie: hit by car (which implies that the individual was not in a car when struck; car crash (the individual was in a car when struck); dragged (individual was not in a car when dragging occurred).\nExplosion: Any explosion caused by a variety of weapons, (IED, gas station, grenade, dynamite, etc.)\nNon-conflict: Indicates that the death occurred outside of a conflict or political situation\n[Blank]: Left blank if precise cause of death is unknown\n\n\n\n\n\ncause_medical: brief, nominal description of the medical cause of the death\n\nA succinct medical description of why the person died; what hospitals report or what appears in an autopsy. Generally a noun phrase laden with jargon.\nGiven the technical language, it’s generally good to keep untranslated language here, unless we are really confident of the wording.\n\n\n\n‘munition’ assesses whether live ammunition and other dangerous explosives were used in the killing. The order below indicates both relative danger and a prioritization for coding. (That is, if someone was both shot with live ammunition and teargassed, we code “Live ammunition” (1) instead of “Tear gas” (3).)\nFormerly live_ammunition; Alluvial2.Rmd has code to deal with both cases.\n\nmunition: (note that explosive is a new category)\n\nDenotes if live ammunition was used and other categories of ammunition.\n\nLive ammunition: live ammunition / standard gunshot. “Bala,” “balazo,” “proyectil arma de fuego,” “raffaga” in sources all count as yes. So do descriptions involving named types of guns.\nExplosive: Indicates an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nLess lethal munition: non-”live ammunition” projectile. Non-lethal/less-lethal munitions (tear gas canister, rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description.\nTear gas: Tear gas (not the canister)\nOther violence: (was “N/A”) No munitions of any kind are involved but physical violence still took place. Ex. Torture, beating, vehicle, stabbing, arson. As such, this category still indicates some form of interpersonal interaction/violence.\nNone: No weapon at all was used. Death was the result of illness or fall, drowning, electrocution, etc.\n[Blank] — We don’t know what weapon was used.\nLikely [category name] as described for quasilogicals\nTwo potential possibilties are linked with or\n\n\n\n\n\nvictim_armed: Quasilogical on whether the decedent was armed\n\n\nYes only if carrying a gun. “Presumed Yes,” if member of a security force, but we lack specific information. No if non-lethal/less-lethal munitions.\nDisarmed — an additional value that indicates that the subject carried a lethal weapon, but was disarmed of it prior to being killed.\nWith Explosive — If the victim carried an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nPresumed Yes — We presume that state security force members are armed. (Though obviously we don’t ignore evidence to the contrary.)\nWe presume that when sources describe a group the victim was part of as armed, but do not specifically note that the victim was armed, the victim was armed.\nPresumed No — We presume uninvolved bystanders, children, and those engaged in explicitly non-confrontational protest (e.g., hunger strikers) are unarmed.\nLikely Yes, Likely No, Disputed, blank as described for quasilogicals\n\n\nweapon: What weapon was used? Nominal factor. Weapon listed when in need of clarification. If the death could have been caused by more than one option, a slash is used to indicate alternatives. Options, in priority order:\n\n\nBullet — Always the term for gunfire with live ammunition. We’re completely un-interested in descriptions of the firing weapons. No “rifles,” “pistols” etc.\nLess-lethal munition —If specific munition is not known “less lethal munition” is used. If specific munition is known it is listed.\nNon-lethal/less-lethal munitions options include: (rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description. Also includes bladed weapons such as knifes and machetes. But not tear gas or teargas canisters, which get their own categories.\n\n\nTear-gas canister — for effects of its physical impact\nTear gas (no hyphen) — for effects of inhalation\nExplosive- cazabobos, grenade etc.\nProjectile — things that are thrown, hurled, or slingshotted. Specific weapon listed in parentheses\n\n\nArson- Purposefully induced fire\nTorture- Denotes that torture is specifically noted in the reports of the death. No researcher judgment was made in the term.\nStrangulation- Some weapon was used to strangle the victim\nBeating — no weapons, but violent interpersonal force\nNon-conflict accident- Death was caused outside of a conflict incident\nFall- Denotes that the victim fell from some surface(often while fleeing conflict repression). From where the victim fell is indicated in ().\nVehicle: Some type of vehicle accident was involved. The type of incident is indicated in ().\nGas station explosion\nStones/rocks\nNone: No weapon was involved. Includes drowning, some falls etc.\nBlank: The specific weapon used is unknown\n\nPriority order means that if something matches two of the options listed here, we report the first one. So yes, a tear-gas canister is a projectile, but we don’t have to say both.\n\n\n\n\n\nperp_catgory: Type: Individual/Group/None: Was the killing done by one person, by a group acting together, or not the result of external action.\n\n\nIndividual includes solitary acts of violence. It also includes instances where a group is protesting/repressing, but only one person deploys lethal force. Also includes instances in which a conflict accident occurs (such as faulty manipulation of dynamite)\nGroup includes any time when a group is engaged in common violence towards the victim or the group the victim is a part of.\nSelf Intentionally deadly acts of self-sacrifice. Neither includes conflict accidents (such as faulty manipulation of dynamite), nor unforeseen losses in acts of self-risking protest\nNone should be used whenever there is no external act of violence: death on hunger strike, from exposure to cold, electrocution on an electric fence.\n\n\nperp_group is a specific organization.\n\nIf known, the specific branch of the military is listed. If not known, “State security” is listed. Where multiple organizations or security forces collaborate, list them all here.\n\nPresumed: Indicates that a conclusion that we draw about the variable based on other facts of the case, in a systematic way. For example, for victim_armed, presumed yes/no indicates that the victim falls into a category which would predispose them to having or not having a weapon even if such was not indicated. These rules should be written into the codebook, and should be relatively strong.\nLikely – Indicates that the researcher is making a judgment based on the source information provided. Explanations of these judgment calls should be written in parentheses (if brief), or into the narrative for the event.\nLeave blank if unclear or unknown If multiple groups involved use comma to denote AND. If unsure about potential groups involved use / to denote OR.\n\n\nperp_affiliation is a broad sectoral group. Same categories as for dec_affiliation. See above.\n\n\n\n\n\nintentionality indicates if the violence inflicted on the victim was an intended consequence.\n\nOptions: If weapon, arson, or assault involved…\n\nDirect: Deadly force was used deliberately, and they were struck. This includes cases where the weapon (e.g. a teargas canister or tear gas itself) is usually nonlethal. We can assess such cases by looking at the weapons involved. This also includes victims of beatings, assaults, deaths from physical confrontations (unless the victim is a bystander). This also includes instances of mistaken identification.\nBystander: A deliberate attack that killed someone outside of the conflict (e.g. Victor Hugo Daza in 2000)\nRe: journalists, mediators, etc.: Let’s flag these as “Direct on journalist/mediator/etc” and try to see if there’s something to figure out. From what I can tell, there are several instances of deliberately targeted journalists (Encinas, the Alta Loma journalist guide, Radio Municipal death, etc.). I’m not sure there is a clear instance of a bystander.\nConflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., weapons misfires, dynamite that explodes in the hand of a protester). Includes “Friendly fire”: Any unintended death that was caused through acts of violence, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict and which strikes someone with whom they are acting together.\n\nRegardless of whether a weapon was involved… 5. Self-sacrifice: includes starvation in hunger strike, suicide (related to conflict incident), or intentionally self-inflicted death with a weapon . Explicitly excludes accidental self-inflicted death with a weapon (those are conflict accidents).\nWhen no weapon is involved… 6. Conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., protesters pull down a wall, but kill someone in the process; electrocution in the process of scaling a secured facility) 7. Non-conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, and outside the context of open physical confrontation: e.g., car crash into a protest march (which the driver was not targeting) 8. Non-conflict: Any other death whose causes can’t be traced to acts of conflict, but for which the word “accidental” is inappropriate. Includes situations where a medical situation leads to death, but is not traceable to the privations of conflict. And situations where interpersonal violence is not related to political conflict (e.g., armed robbery), and cases of non-conflict-driven suicides. 9. Incidental: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon the participants. Deaths from the privations of nationwide marches, or due to the follow-on trauma of police raid. (or if someone had died in Chaparina when the police blockaded the marchers and denied access to food). Includes deaths to children of participants collateral to their acts. 10. Collateral: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon non-participants. Deaths from lack of medical attention due to blockades, consequences of re-routed plane flights, etc.\n&gt;&gt; Possibility of unknown or disputed causality, as in the case of Campanas during the Water War. Weapon is “hanging”; Intentionality is disputed between direct/self-sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this information to create a Geo-tag if possible: We’re not implementing this for now, but it’s desirable for later in the project. Please add further information not captured in these fields to Notes.\n\nplace: A named or described place\nlocation_precision: How specific is the geocoded address. Refers to columns to the right, not to place\n\naddress: Specific address, eg: 1 Main St.\n\npoi_small: A small nt of interest, eg: Jim's Pizza.\n\nintersection: Intersection of two roads, eg: 6th Avenue and Izabel Street\n\nblock: Block level address, eg: 100 Block of Main St.\n\npoi_large: A large nt of interest, eg: Central Mall.\n\nroad: Road name, eg: Glenwood Drive\n\ncommunity: Neighborhood or rural community\ntown: Specifically the town or urban area associated with municipality\nrural_zone: The rural portion of the place named\nmunicipalty, province, department: Only specified to these legal areas\n\nregion: A larger-than municipality region, like the Chapare or the La Paz Yungas.\n\naddress: Street Address / Intersection. A street, intersection, or street address\ncommunity Urban neighborhood or rural community\n\nNearly all urban places have neighborhood names. Many rural communities are smaller units than municipalities.\n\nmunicipality\nprovince\ndepartment\n\nWe use Spanish accents: Potosí, not Potosi. Never write “X Municipality,” just X is fine. Complete list of municipalities. Complete list of provinces, with a lovely table of municipalities and cantons (submunicipal sections). Wikipedia (usually English, sometimes German) and several other Google-able websites can locate obscure communities. Be forewarned that many new settlements (urban neighborhoods, recent agrarian settlements in Chapare and the east) are named after other ones, so do not Google a community name and “learn” from the search that it is located in another department across the country. If in doubt, check in about this.\nThe number of municipalities in Bolivia has risen from an initial twenty-four (in 1994) to 327 (in 2005), to 337 (in April 2010), to 339 (as of August 2010). Where municipal boundaries have changed, we use specific locality to specify the current, smaller municipality. But if no information is available on a smaller scale than the municipality name, we use the named municipality. If you look up a rural community in a post-2011 reference work to find the municipality, but the event is before 2011, make a note in “complications” saying so.\nProvincial and departmental boundaries (where set and undisputed) have been unchanged through this period.\n\n\n\n\nThese fields allow us to specify the reasons for confidence in identifying who was the perpetrator of violence, the kind of information they used, and whether responsibility has been denied.\n\nhighest_source\n\nThe strongest source naming the perpetrator as the database does.\n\ncertainty_level: Level of Certainty Re Perpetrator\n\nGenerally, Suspected &lt; Alleged &lt; Reported &lt; Audiovisual documentation &lt; Investigated &lt; Admitted &lt; Convicted. Indicate highest level and explain in “Strongest Source”\n\nSuspected — A source suspects (without saying definitively) that a person or party was responsible for the killing\nAlleged — A source (often non-neutral) alleges that a person or party was responsible for the killing. (Does not require a legal allegation.\nReported — A reputable, neutral source has stated that the person or party was responsible for the killing. This level encompasses most news reporting.\nAudiovisual documentation — There is direct video, photographic, or (less common) audio evidences that the person or party was responsible for the killing.\nInvestigated — A reputable source has investigated the incident and concluded that the person or party was responsible for the killing.\nAdmitted — The responsible party acknowledges responsibility. Includes recorded statements, confessions, and guilty pleas. While this is a higher level of certainty, investigations that conclude this kind of evidence is inaccurate (e.g., coerced or false) may override such statements.\nConvicted — A reputable judicial process, following a prior investigation, held the party responsible.\n\n\ndenial Did the perpetrator or affiliates deny responsibility?\n\n\nNo — Perpetrator (or their hierarchical superior) does not deny responsibility for the injury/death. Essentially only use this when there is an admission of responsibility.\nYes — Perpetrator (or their hierarchical superior) denies responsibility for the injury/death or claims it from alternate causes that what victim’s family/friends/fellow protesters claim. All details should be spelled out in the denied_by column in the formats: Official Title John Q. Denier: “Quote saying we didn’t do it” or Official Title John Q. Denier (brief summary of denial story).\nPartial — Denied some aspect of the story-use of specific weapon or culpability. No denial of events but denial of responsibility or an aspect of the narrative.\nLikely Yes, Likely No, Disputed, blank as described for quasilogicals\n\nIf we accept the denial as genuinely factual, we don’t include it here. In that case the falsely accused perpetrator doesn’t appear as the “perpetrator” at all.\nThere is no pressure to convert blanks into “No.” Only affirmative evidence of accepted responsibility gets a no. We should expect there will be many blanks here.\nNote on disputed vs denial: This research project takes responsibility for evaluating categorical variables. If we are indicating “disputed,” that means not only is the answer disputed, but also that we cannot resolve the dispute. On the other hand, we have a variable for “denial” in the database that will absorb explanations by interested parties that are judged implausible. There are many cases when officials (and occasionally other responsible parties) make claims that deny their responsibility and put it on the victims. Those will be recorded as full or partial denials in the denial variable, and explained in the denied_by variable. (For a detailed explanation of the thought process involved in this, see “Why I evaluated the government claims that protesters “shot one another” as a denial rather than throwing all the facts in question” here).\n\ndenied_by Attribute the denial to a person or institution.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral approach is to modify yes / no structure as described below. Unknown is blank.\n\n\n\ndisciplinary_acct Internal accountability process within a state institution\nSpecify accountability process: e.g., Internal investigation, suspended, fired. Keep this short but tell us the topline details. e.g., “All involved officers suspended”\nNo — Only when we have sources asserting no accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\njudicial_acct Judicial process, successful or unsuccessful, domestic or international\nSpecify forum and current outcome:: e.g., Criminal indictment, US Federal Court case filed.. Keep this short but tell us the topline details. Describe in detail in the notes.\nEventually, we want to have clarity about when these efforts were frustrated, but for now just clearly state things like acquitted.\nNo — Only when we have sources asserting no accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nhr_report Human rights reporting and investigation\n\nRefers only to reporting that was specific to the incident, often with an investigative team focusing on the event.\n\nvictim_compensated Material compensation for the victim’s family\nYes — With topline details in parentheses\nNo — If evidence or our knowledge make clear that there was no material compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npres_admin Which presidency was active during the event\n\nA very straightforward mapping to time period. Do not consider the “president in exercise” when a president is out of the country. Should match list on the “By Presidency” tab.\n\nRené Barrientos\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas\nAlfredo Ovando Candía\nJuan José Torres\nHugo Banzer (1st)\nJuan Pereda\nDavid Padilla (Chairman of the Military Junta)\nWálter Guevara\nAlberto Natusch\nLydia Gueiler Tejada\nLuis García Meza Tejada (2nd)\nJunta of Commanders of the Armed Forces 1981\nCelso Torrelio\nGuido Vildoso\nHernán Siles Zuazo\nVíctor Paz Estenssoro\nJaime Paz Zamora\nGonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (1st)\nHugo Banzer (2nd)\nJorge Quiroga\nGonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (2nd)\nCarlos Diego Mesa Gisbert\nEduardo Rodriguez\nEvo Morales\nInterim military government\nJeanine Áñez\nLuis Arce\n\nThese names—imported from Wikipedia—have some inconsistencies in the Spanish naming conventions, as well as confusion about why we’ve numbered Banzer “2nd” (he served before the study period). While we’ve deferred to them so far, we should probably clean them up and make required changes to the code before our release.\n\n\n\nGenerally, there will be a nesting of event_title, protest_campaign, protest_domain.\n\nprotest_campaign: A unique identifier that indicates the specific topic over which conflict emerged. Campaign is determined through identifying overarching demands, complaints, or tension that sparked the conflict.\n\nThis field is left blank in cases where the victim died in custody, enough information is not known to detail a specific campaign, or in non-conflict related accidents such as the journalist suicide with explosive device.\n\nprotest_domain Broad arena of political struggle, combining multiple campaigns.\n\nExplanations given for domains as needed (if they are not self implied)\nCurrent list: - Coca: Conflicts involving disputes over right to grow coca - Gas wars - Rural Land: Conflicts over territorial borders/boundaries occurring in rural areas. For example, the Laymi-Qaqachaka confrontations. - Partisan Politics - Mining - Economic Policies - Labor - Peasant - Municipal governance: Disputes or conflicts over elected officials in the municipal government. - Urban land: Conflicts over territorial borders or land ownership in urban areas. For example, the Pampa San Miguel urban land conflict. - Drug Trade - Guerilla - Ethno-Ecological: Mobilizations over the protection of the environment and/or protection or authority over cultural connections to land and environmental resources. For example, the TIPNIS mobilizations. - Local Development - Disabled: Mobilizations surrounding the rights of those with disabilities - Paramilitary - Contraband - Education\n\n\n\n\npol_assassination: Quasilogical. We define “political assassinations” as targeted killings of persons in organizational leadership or political office.

This “catastrophic stalemate” was a deadlock between a broad coalition of the rural and urban indigenous peoples, movements of the poor and working class (collectively, the “left grassroots”) and the Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism (MAS-IPSP) party on one side, and a political opposition backed by right-wing “civic movements” calling for regional autonomy from that government. While the heart of the right’s resistance to the Morales government was the eastern departments (Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija), major episodes occurred in the central cities of Cochabamba and Sucre. In Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, and Beni, (and possibly Pando and Tarija) there’s a departmental Civic Committee at the heart of the civic movement. However, in Potosí there is an a political active civic committee whose positioning is solidly with the left grassroots.\nDuring the 2019 Political Crisis\n\nPerpetrator Political Affiliation: Pro-MAS or Anti-MAS or Security Forces\nVictim Political Affiliation: Pro-MAS or Anti-MAS or Security Forces or Bystander or Other Protest (i.e., participating in a protest not part of the crisis)\n\n\n\n\nMeta-comment about cleaing up the following… While this is all important material for producing the borader archive, the R package simply skips over the narrative variables, so we don’t have to complete this to complete and release the R package.\n\n\n\ncomplications Text.

Sequences of quoted text.\n\nSince a database text field is an awkward place for extended text, these should eventually be saved into separate Markdown files which can have proper citations.\nQuotes ultimately belong there, in those files, not here.\nCurrently, there are cited narratives written on a one-per-event basis. These exist alongside these notes sections. Eventually, it probably makes the most sense to build a library and a file structure of such documents. This will involve untangling the writing and referencing here. Perhaps there will be both overall narratives and specific material attached to individuals.\n Going further, we may create a lookup table by individual to such event files, as well as to photos, testimonial accounts (or more likely, the metadata for these will have nters to individuals in the dataset), and other person-specific data. However, this will go along with the creation of unique identifiers for persons in the project, which is one more thing that may require a re-factoring of the dataset import process.\n\n\n\n\nrefs: References.\n\nA list of referenced materials. Separate with |\nAcceptable formats:\n\nCommonly reused sources in Author Date:Page format. For example, Miranda 2013:37.\nFull bibliographic entry, generated by Zotero, with the source stored in our shared library. Ideally in Chicago (full note) format. Use this format for newspaper articles photographed in archives.\nBare URLs for references. There are lots of these, but we want to store them all in Zotero and replace them with full references, as well as get “snapshots” of the material into the Zotero library. It would be incredibly nice to innovate a script or workflow that harvests these URLs, keeps track of where they appeared, checks for valid online data, adds bibliographic entries to Zotero, and ultimately replaces the bare URLs with proper citations.\n\n\n\n\n\nsee_also: Follow-ups and cross-references\n\nUse this column to refer to: - Bibliographic references (formatted as in refs) to sources that do not describe the death, but do describe memorial events, commemorations, statues, and other sequelae to the death.\n\nCross-references to other deaths: Indicate briefly and clearly the relationship to another death\nJoining several deaths to the same sub-event, for example among the many deaths of the Sep-Oct 2003 Gas War.\n\n\n\n\n\nnavarro_2006_number: Place in Navarro 2006’s numbered list\n\nThere is a mulitpage numbered list of deaths in Navarro Miranda, César. Crímenes de la democracia neoliberal y movimientos sociales: desde la masacre de Villa Tunari a El Alto. La Paz: Fondo Editorial de los Diputados, 2006.\nThis column tracks which deaths listed there appear in which lines in our dataset. Several discrepancies have been identified as we have researched this list.\n\n\n\n\nThese variables are no longer in use in the database.\n\n\n\ncoldblood: Quasilogical Was this a “cold blood” killing?\n\nThis is one possible emergent categories that do correspond to individual deaths. Clarify definitions and consider whether to focus first on the narrower “repressive overkill” term. This will not be in the first public release of the dataset.\n\n\n\nWe should deprecate these variables and rewrite the code so they aren’t considered. A different implementation has already been accomplished by creating relevant columns on the “Event Status” page. * repression_success: Did the repressions succeed? Categorical, with three options. - Repression success\n\nMovement success\nPartial movement success\noutcomes: Capsule summary of protest event outcome\n\n\n\n\n\nNone right now."

    "text": "The database treats events as a fundamental unit. Event is a term with many definitions in the study of social movements and contentious politics from the pivotal historical moment to the action at a single time and place as recorded by news media, but the meaning used in the database is perhaps best captured by Charles Tilly’s term episodes: ”bounded sequences of continuous interaction.” Bolivian mass mobilisation is organized in a routine sequence — collective organisation, mass mobilisation, escalation of tactics, negotiation, and concessions — and organizers work to propel the process forward repeatedly until the target, usually the government, gives in. Repressive force seeks to interrupt this process, usually by punishing movements in the mobilisation or escalation stages. For purposes of the database, we treat a relatively continuous series of actions as a single episode or event, unless and until it is interrupted by demobilisation.\n\n\n\nevent_title: Provides location and general theme of event\n\nEvent titles are brief, unique textual identifiers that should readily bring to mind the event (especially if the reader has heard of it before), and inform us as to what makes it distinctive. Therefore, unlike other elements of this codebook, there is rarely a single right answer. Also, we should be working to make these titles distinct, so when there are a lot of parallel events, we will need to be more specific.\nUse well-known names for events, if possible.\nThe event_title should state the scope of the conflict; name a locality or workplace if the conflict (or the notable deadly violence) is local. If the conflict is widespread, it should more often name the movement involved. It should name the social movement sector involved if relevant.\nIt should not name the form of violence unless it is unusual.\nUnique means that each event_title is distinct from all others in the dataset. Where needed add the year at the end of the event_title, then month or month pair. For example “Gas War 2003”, “CSUTCB mobilization April 2000.”\nThe variables, and this document are segmented into sections, each of which comprise several variables."

For example- if a person died in a fire the cause of death would be the building burning. The Medical cause of death would be burns.\n\nIf coinciding factors resulted in a death, a comma is used to symbolize plurality. Ex. (gunshot, impact)= (gunshot and impact).\nIf reports consistently note two different causes of death and the exact cause is not known a slash is used to denote OR. Ex. (gunshot/beating)= (gunshot or beating).\nBlank spaces indicate that cause of death is unknown.\nCauses of death include the following. This list is not exhaustive; other categories not listed below, but included in the database are self-explanatory.\n\nInduced health crisis: (induced via social circumstances including extra stress due to protest conditions or previous accident or injury sustained in a political event)\nIllness: An illness that occured during but not as a result of political events\nLack of necessary care: (lack of needed care due to difficulty reaching care and/or external forces preventing care. If the person was injured and then prevented from reaching necessary care, the injury is listed first in cause of death and more specific circumstances are detailed in the notes).\nGunshot: Fatal wound incurred from a gun (live ammunition)\nImpact: hit with an object thrown or projected at them during protest (rocks, stones, tear gas canister). Not from a gun or interpersonal beating.\nAssault: signifies an attack that can include both a beating and weapons such as knifes and machetes\nBeating: No weapons were used, violent interpersonal force\nVehicle: Incident involving a vehicle. Specifics of death are noted in parentheses, ie: hit by car (which implies that the individual was not in a car when struck; car crash (the individual was in a car when struck); dragged (individual was not in a car when dragging occurred).\nExplosion: Any explosion caused by a variety of weapons, (IED, gas station, grenade, dynamite, etc.)\nNon-conflict: Indicates that the death occurred outside of a conflict or political situation\n[Blank]: Left blank if precise cause of death is unknown\n\n\n\n\n\ncause_medical: brief, nominal description of the medical cause of the death\n\nA succinct medical description of why the person died; what hospitals report or what appears in an autopsy. Generally a noun phrase laden with jargon.\nGiven the technical language, it’s generally good to keep untranslated language here, unless we are really confident of the wording.\n\n\n\n‘munition’ assesses whether live ammunition and other dangerous explosives were used in the killing. The order below indicates both relative danger and a prioritization for coding. (That is, if someone was both shot with live ammunition and teargassed, we code “Live ammunition” (1) instead of “Tear gas” (3).)\nFormerly live_ammunition; Alluvial2.Rmd has code to deal with both cases.\n\nmunition: (note that explosive is a new category)\n\nDenotes if live ammunition was used and other categories of ammunition.\n\nLive ammunition: live ammunition / standard gunshot. “Bala,” “balazo,” “proyectil arma de fuego,” “raffaga” in sources all count as yes. So do descriptions involving named types of guns.\nExplosive: Indicates an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nLess lethal munition: non-”live ammunition” projectile. Non-lethal/less-lethal munitions (tear gas canister, rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description.\nTear gas: Tear gas (not the canister)\nOther violence: (was “N/A”) No munitions of any kind are involved but physical violence still took place. Ex. Torture, beating, vehicle, stabbing, arson. As such, this category still indicates some form of interpersonal interaction/violence.\nNone: No weapon at all was used. Death was the result of illness or fall, drowning, electrocution, etc.\n[Blank] — We don’t know what weapon was used.\nLikely [category name] as described for quasilogicals\nTwo potential possibilties are linked with or\n\n\n\n\n\nvictim_armed: Quasilogical on whether the decedent was armed\n\n\nYes only if carrying a gun. “Presumed Yes,” if member of a security force, but we lack specific information. No if non-lethal/less-lethal munitions.\nDisarmed — an additional value that indicates that the subject carried a lethal weapon, but was disarmed of it prior to being killed.\nWith Explosive — If the victim carried an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nPresumed Yes — We presume that state security force members are armed. (Though obviously we don’t ignore evidence to the contrary.)\nWe presume that when sources describe a group the victim was part of as armed, but do not specifically note that the victim was armed, the victim was armed.\nPresumed No — We presume uninvolved bystanders, children, and those engaged in explicitly non-confrontational protest (e.g., hunger strikers) are unarmed.\nLikely Yes, Likely No, Disputed, blank as described for quasilogicals\n\n\nweapon: What weapon was used? Nominal factor. Weapon listed when in need of clarification. If the death could have been caused by more than one option, a slash is used to indicate alternatives. Options, in priority order:\n\n\nBullet — Always the term for gunfire with live ammunition. We’re completely un-interested in descriptions of the firing weapons. No “rifles,” “pistols” etc.\nLess-lethal munition —If specific munition is not known “less lethal munition” is used. If specific munition is known it is listed.\nNon-lethal/less-lethal munitions options include: (rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description. Also includes bladed weapons such as knifes and machetes. But not tear gas or teargas canisters, which get their own categories.\n\n\nTear-gas canister — for effects of its physical impact\nTear gas (no hyphen) — for effects of inhalation\nExplosive- cazabobos, grenade etc.\nProjectile — things that are thrown, hurled, or slingshotted. Specific weapon listed in parentheses\n\n\nArson- Purposefully induced fire\nTorture- Denotes that torture is specifically noted in the reports of the death. No researcher judgment was made in the term.\nStrangulation- Some weapon was used to strangle the victim\nBeating — no weapons, but violent interpersonal force\nNon-conflict accident- Death was caused outside of a conflict incident\nFall- Denotes that the victim fell from some surface(often while fleeing conflict repression). From where the victim fell is indicated in ().\nVehicle: Some type of vehicle accident was involved. The type of incident is indicated in ().\nGas station explosion\nStones/rocks\nNone: No weapon was involved. Includes drowning, some falls etc.\nBlank: The specific weapon used is unknown\n\nPriority order means that if something matches two of the options listed here, we report the first one. So yes, a tear-gas canister is a projectile, but we don’t have to say both."

I’m not sure there is a clear instance of a bystander.\nConflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., weapons misfires, dynamite that explodes in the hand of a protester). Includes “Friendly fire”: Any unintended death that was caused through acts of violence, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict and which strikes someone with whom they are acting together.\n\nRegardless of whether a weapon was involved… 5. Self-sacrifice: includes starvation in hunger strike, suicide (related to conflict incident), or intentionally self-inflicted death with a weapon . Explicitly excludes accidental self-inflicted death with a weapon (those are conflict accidents).\nWhen no weapon is involved… 6. Conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., protesters pull down a wall, but kill someone in the process; electrocution in the process of scaling a secured facility) 7. Non-conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, and outside the context of open physical confrontation: e.g., car crash into a protest march (which the driver was not targeting) 8. Non-conflict: Any other death whose causes can’t be traced to acts of conflict, but for which the word “accidental” is inappropriate. Includes situations where a medical situation leads to death, but is not traceable to the privations of conflict. And situations where interpersonal violence is not related to political conflict (e.g., armed robbery), and cases of non-conflict-driven suicides. 9. Incidental: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon the participants. Deaths from the privations of nationwide marches, or due to the follow-on trauma of police raid. (or if someone had died in Chaparina when the police blockaded the marchers and denied access to food). Includes deaths to children of participants collateral to their acts. 10. Collateral: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon non-participants. Deaths from lack of medical attention due to blockades, consequences of re-routed plane flights, etc.\n&gt;&gt; Possibility of unknown or disputed causality, as in the case of Campanas during the Water War. Weapon is “hanging”; Intentionality is disputed between direct/self-sacrifice."

Where municipal boundaries have changed, we use specific locality to specify the current, smaller municipality. But if no information is available on a smaller scale than the municipality name, we use the named municipality.

Includes recorded statements, confessions, and guilty pleas.

If we are indicating “disputed,” that means not only is the answer disputed, but also that we cannot resolve the dispute. On the other hand, we have a variable for “denial” in the database that will absorb explanations by interested parties that are judged implausible. There are many cases when officials (and occasionally other responsible parties) make claims that deny their responsibility and put it on the victims. Those will be recorded as full or partial denials in the denial variable, and explained in the denied_by variable. (For a detailed explanation of the thought process involved in this, see “Why I evaluated the government claims that protesters “shot one another” as a denial rather than throwing all the facts in question” here).\n\ndenied_by Attribute the denial to a person or institution."

Supported files include .md, .Rmd, .qmd, .ipynb…\nUpdate _quarto.yml as needed (for example, if you’ve created a new file you’d like included in your site)\nRender individual files and/or the whole website\nRepeat, repeat, repeat\nCommit and push your website to GitHub, your updates will publish automatically!\nRepeat all of the above to make the website as you’d like!\n\nNote: if editing from your internet browser we won’t render in Step 3. That step will not be separate, but combined with Step 5, which will only require a commit, not a push."
